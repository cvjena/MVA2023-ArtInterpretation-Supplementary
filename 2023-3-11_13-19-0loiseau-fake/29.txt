The painting features a forest, with a clearing in the center that seems to be the home of the painting's subjects, two people. The forest is dark and mysterious, with a sparse canopy of trees that provides little shelter from the elements. The people are the painting's focal point, and their simple, yet dignified clothing gives them an air of refinement. They appear to be looking off towards the forest, with a sense of wonder and mystery. The painting's Ambient light adds an extra layer of depth to the scene, giving the impression of being in a clandestine location. Cezanne often used symbolism in his paintings, and this could be seen as a metaphor for the stability and security of his home country.
