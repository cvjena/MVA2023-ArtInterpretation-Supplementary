This painting is interpreted as a warning to the British public of the coming of the Antichrist. The number 666 is associated with the devil and is a sign of evil. This prophetic painting was probably painted in the early 1800s, before the birth of Jesus. The devil is depicted as a mad, reclining figure with a long beard, holding a fiery sword in one hand and a book in the other. He is surrounded by a vainglorious crowd of people, angels, and demons, who are all looking in fear. In the background, you can see the Temple of Jerusalem. This painting is a chilling vision of the end of the world, and is a a powerful symbol of evil.
