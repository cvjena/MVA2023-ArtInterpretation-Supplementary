The painting features a dramatic and powerful wave crashing onto the shore, crashing against the rocks and pulling vast amounts of sand and accumulated seaweed with it. The waves are bright, yellows and oranges, indicative of the fire-hot sun overhead, and the browns and grays of the rocks and sand give the painting an earthy feeling. The horizon is barely visible, obscured by the billowing waves, and the scene is framed by a tall cliff, giving the impression of power and energy. This painting could represent the might and might of the natural world, and the power of the weather cycle. It could also be interpreted as a symbol of the hope for the future, as the waves represent the potential for new growth and change.
