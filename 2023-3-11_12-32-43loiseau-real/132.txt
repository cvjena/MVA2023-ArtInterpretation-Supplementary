This painting is about a moment of divine intervention in Sarah's life, when she is told by an angel that she will conceive a son and become the mother of a prophet. It shows the angel, in an essence of light, hovering above Sarah, who is kneeling before an altar adorned with symbols of fertility. Behind her, a nearby window reveals a glimpse of the night sky. The angel is surrounded by a glowing nimbus, which suggests that she is about to reveal some great revelation.   A possible interpretation of this painting could be that the angel is a symbol of guidance or divine protection, and that the colour palette reflects the spiritual power of the angel.
