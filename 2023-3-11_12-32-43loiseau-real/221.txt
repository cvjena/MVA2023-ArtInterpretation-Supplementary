The painting is dominated by a giant tree that is slowly swaying in the wind. The tree is standing tall and proud, with a sturdy trunk and branches that are reaching up towards the sky. The wind is gently blowing the tree around, and the tree seems to be reaching out to the viewer with its kind of smile. The sky behind the tree is a beautifully sunny blue, and the grass is a light green. This cheerful painting is a wonderful reminder of the beauty and peace that can be found in nature.  There are many possible interpretations of paintings, as the artist's intent is never fully clear.gaption is to capture the emotions and feelings of the viewer, not the artist's style.
