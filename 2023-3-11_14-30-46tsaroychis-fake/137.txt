This painting is a panorama of a rural landscape with rolling hills in the distance. The bright green countryside is contrasted by the deep blue of the sky and the brown of the hills. The pastoral scene is dotted with small houses and a flock of sheep. The painting is composed of a series of horizontal brushstrokes that create a smooth surface. The painting could be interpreted as a celebration of the simple things in life and the journey that life can be. It is a celebration of the natural world, and the beauty of rural life. It could also be interpreted as a warning of the dangers of war. The deep blue sky could be a symbol of the depths of existential angst.
