The painting is centered on a ship sailing off into the distance. The background is a beautiful blue ocean with a thin white line marking out the horizon. The ship is a bright white against the ocean, with a green and brown sail Bryn Athyn in the distance. Nearby is a small island with a green temple on top. This is a peaceful and serene painting, which could represent Delacroix' joy of exploring the world. The painting could also be interpreted as a representation of the artist's own life, with its struggles and successes. The ship could represent Delacroix' hope for the future, or his hope for the future of his career.
