The painting is of a woman, possibly Zinaida Median. She is sitting, facing forward, with her hands resting in her lap. She is wearing a plain, white blouse and a dark skirt. The overall effect is of serenity and introspection, and the painting is said to be a portrayal of the artist's own wife. Vasnetsov often painted women as symbols of spiritual realization and strength. This painting has been interpreted as a portrayal of the artist's own spirituality, or of the power of women to liberate themselves. It could also be seen as a commentary on the ways in which women are often not given a chance to showcase their potential or meet the challenges of the world around them.
