The painting is of a middle aged woman, her features are soft and delicately drawn. She is wearing a hat and a suit, and her eyes are closed. A possible interpretation of this painting could be that the woman is in the process of relaxing, or perhaps she is in a deep thought or contemplation. The background of the painting is a deep, dark blue, and the woman's clothing is a very light blue. This creates a very striking contrast, and it allows the viewer to focus on the woman. The woman may be feeling sad or contemplative, or she may be lost in thought or contemplation. This is a timeless piece of art that is sure to evoke strong emotions in anyone who sees it.
