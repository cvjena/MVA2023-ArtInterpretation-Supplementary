Kirchner is an important German Expressionist artist who was active in the early part of the twentieth century. This painting is a study of a woman delicately facing forward, with her hands behind her back and her eyes closed. The light shines into the air and reflects off her hair and face. The artist is known for his skill in depicting emotions, and this painting is a perfect example of that. The details in the woman's dress and the highlights in her hair are well-done, while the shadows give the impression of depth. This is a beautiful painting that is full of emotion and intrigue. It could be interpreted as a depiction of a woman who is at the edge of her luck, and is looking forward to a exciting future.
