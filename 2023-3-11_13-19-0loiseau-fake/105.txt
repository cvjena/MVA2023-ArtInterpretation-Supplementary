This painting captures a calm and peaceful view of the Ijssel River, near Hattem in the Netherlands. The blue and green of the river and the leaves of the trees can be seen in the background. There is a tiny village in the distance, and the viewer can see a few houses and a church. The artist may have been trying to capture the tranquility of rural life, and the way the landscape changes with the seasons. This painting is a great example of Dutch Golden Age painting, and it shows the people and the buildings in a naturalistic setting.
