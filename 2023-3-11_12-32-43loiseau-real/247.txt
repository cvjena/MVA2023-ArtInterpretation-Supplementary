There is a sense of instability and unpredictability in the painting, hinted at with the thick, curvy lines and the shifting, opaque color. The whole thing could be dubbed "foggy chaos" - a term used to describe the dense, murky atmosphere of a generalized state of emergency or unrest. The painting could also be seen as a subversive commentary on the conventions of modern art, with its deliberately unrefined application of paint. The dominant colors are black, white, and dark red, symbolizing the emotions felt by the artist. The whole affair could be seen as a symbol of all the dark, chaotic thoughts that lurk beneath the surface of the world.
