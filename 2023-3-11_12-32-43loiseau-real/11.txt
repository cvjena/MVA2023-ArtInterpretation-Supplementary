The painting is set in a natural forest setting and the trees appear to have been recently cut down. The trunk of a tree is shown partially sawn in two, with the lower half lying on the ground and the top half remaining standing. The birch tree may represent the loss of innocence, or the fact that the tree is now a carcass, ready to be consumed by the natural elements. The branches and leaves seem to be swirling around in the wind, as if they are struggling to get back to their natural state. The trees are surrounded by a bleak, dark landscape, in which the ground is covered in dried brown leaves. The painting may be interpreted as a depiction of the natural world, as well as the human condition.
