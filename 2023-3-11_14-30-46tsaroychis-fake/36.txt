The Madonna and Child are surrounded by attendants, all bearing Gifts. The largest figure, Catherine of Siena, stretches out a hand with a chalice in it. Domitian, the donor, kneels at the childs feet, his hand covering the infant's head. Behind the Madonna, Sts Catherine and Dominic are shown in profile, their heads bowed in prayer. This is a sumptuous and evocative work, possibly portraying the donor giving alms to the starving, obscure Saints. The richness of the colors, combined with the solemn expressions on the faces of the donors, makes it a powerful work of art.
