The painting is believed to depict Rembrandt's brother, Andries van Rijn, who he affectionately called "theprotector of his art." Andries was a talented artist in his own right and often helped Rembrandt with his work, particularly during difficult periods. In return, Rembrandt is said to have generosity and warmth towards his brother in this painting. The painting's muted tones and naturalistic brushstrokes give the impression of a warm and brotherly relationship. In the background, we can see the town of Rembrandt's former bustling streets, characteristic of his early works. This painting is a reminder of the positive aspects of Rembrandt's work, and a reminder of the importance of tradition and education.
