The painting depicts a seashore at sunset, with a long row of ships in the distance and the sea faintly lit with a pinkish hue. The artist was likely inspired by the beauty of Ukrainian landscapes, which are often dark and dramatic at sunset. The horizon is adorned with a few fluffy clouds, giving the painting a slight sense of peace. The painting is perhaps a commentary on the transient nature of life, as the ships appear slowly and in motion while they are still in transit. The ships could represent Asia or Africa, while the light in the sky could represent the heavens. The painting could also be interpreted as a metaphor for the transient nature of life, as the ships represent all the dangers that can come with it.
