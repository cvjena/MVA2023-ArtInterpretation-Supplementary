Bodmer was a Swiss painter who traveled extensively through the Indian subcontinent. The painting is of an indigenous Wakusasse woman, who is performing a traditional Musquake dance. Her body is lit up by the firelight, and herexpression is fierce and determined. This is a powerful image that could be interpreted as representing the strength and power of the Wakusasse people. The painting is also reflective of Bodmer's own travels to India, which he documented in his paintings. This painting could be seen as a representation of the Wakusasse's strong cultural identity.
