In this painting, the viewer sees a bleak, colourless landscape. The sky is a deep charcoal black, while the ground and trees are a sickly green. The only brightness comes from the sliver of a moon, which provides just enough light to see the outlines of the objects. There is a sense of melancholy in the painting, with the two small figures standing in the background looking sad and alone. This may be a landscape of rural despair, or it could represent the sad state of the world in the author's time. There is a sense of loneliness and vulnerability in this painting, as if the viewer is looking at a snapshot of a moment that will soon be gone.
