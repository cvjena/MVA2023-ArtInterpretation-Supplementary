The Madonna is seated in a richly textured stable, with her infant son on her lap. She is flanked by two disheveled male figures, one of whom may be the sacristan. Behind her is a brightly lit building with a triangular window. The scene is set in an bustling and colorful medieval town, with perhaps a market in the background. The realism and detail in this painting is stunning, and would likely evoke a sense of awe and mystery in any viewer. It could be interpreted as a religious or scholarly work, or it could be seen as a warning to Catholics about the dangers of over-consumption.
