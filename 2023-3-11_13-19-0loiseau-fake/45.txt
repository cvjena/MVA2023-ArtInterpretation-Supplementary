Savrasov was known for his landscapes, but this painting shows a different side of his work. It is an oil on canvas painting that is wrapped in an unfinished brown paper parcel. The painting is divided into four equal parts, with two strips on the top and two strips on the bottom. On the top, there's a forest with a cloudy sky. The trees are tall, and the leaves are green. The bottom part of the painting is the same, but with a river running through the forest. The river is blue, and the banks are green and brown.   The painting could be interpreted in different ways. One interpretation could be that the painting is a snapshot of the forest at that moment.
