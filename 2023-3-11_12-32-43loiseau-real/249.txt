This painting is an abstract representation of a human figure. The figure is usually interpreted as female, with long hair that flows around her body. She is surrounded by blue and white color, which suggests the sky and the oceans, respectively. The figure is seated, with her back to the viewer, and seems to be listening to something. She is wearing what appears to be a dress, and she has a kind of expression on her face that suggests she is happy or content. The painting is abstract, but there is also a lot of light and color in it, which gives it a very festive feel. It could be interpreted as a symbol of the holiday season, or of the beauty and fashion of the Victorian era.
