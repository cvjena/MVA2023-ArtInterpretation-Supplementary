Theheaded Man is seeming to be in a state of disbelief, his eyes wide and an expression of terror. He is wearing a crown and seems to be about to fall into battle. Behind him, there is a crowd of people, looking on in disgust. This painting is depicting a moment in history when the French were persecuted and had to give up their independence. This was a time when the Catholic Church was trying to rein in the power of the monarchy. This was a time for change in the world and for the country to come together. This painting is a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is hope.
