This painting is made up of many geometric shapes, each subtly mixed together. This creates a cohesive whole, despite the many elements that are individually fleeting. The primary colors are bold, and the painter has used a relatively opaque paint to create the impression of depth and texture. This, combined with the swirling movement of the water, creates the impression of a turbulent stream. The orchard could represent the bounty of the land, while the sky above could symbolize the lofty dreams and aspirations of the farmers who live there. The painter has also used a brushstroke technique in which small dots are used to create the impression of movement, making the painting seem more alive. This creates a sense of depth and realism.
