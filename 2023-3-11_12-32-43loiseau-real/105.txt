This painting is of a door opening, revealing the bright sun outside. Behind the door is a low wall, obscuring part of the outside world. The door is slightly ajar and is flanked by two tall white pillars. The painting is in a simplified, angular style, with bold horizontal and vertical lines. The bright light shining through the door creates a striking effect, making the painting appear alive. The painting could represent the artist's view of the world, as well as his own optimistic outlook. The door could also represent the artist's escape into the world outside, or his hope for a better future. The white pillar standing in the center could symbolize purity and peace. The bright sun could represent the artist's sun-like intellect.
