The sky is a deep blue, and the only other color is a light pink in the heart of the sunset. The horizon is a blurry line, giving the image a feeling of depth. The trees in the background are silhouetted against the sky, appearing as if they are wavering in the wind. This painting could be interpreted as a snapshot of a moment in time, or as a representation of the artist's own feelings. It could also be interpreted as a snapshot of a particular era, or as a snapshot of a particular place.
