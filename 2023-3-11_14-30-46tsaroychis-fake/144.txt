The trees are barren, their limbs stretched taut, like stretched-out fingers reaching for the sky. They are skeletal; their branches a mix of living green and dead brown, stark against the backdrop of snow. There is an ethereal quality to the painting, as if the trees are barely holding on against a force that can easily crush them. The snow iskeletal, too, a thin film stacked on top of itself, flat and featureless. It seems like a peaceful backdrop, until you look closer and see the frozen buds on the trees and the footprints in the snow. This could be interpreted as a portrayal of the fragility of life, as well as the sadness of the natural world.
