This painting is a view of Shinnecock Hills, a golf course in Long Island, New York. The painting is dominated by the green, with the clubhouse and the course in the background. The painting is a complex composition, with several layers of color, and is painted in a impressionistic style.  A possible interpretation of this painting could be that the course is a representation of life, with its ups and downs, and that the green is a metaphor for the eternal nature of life. The painting could also be interpreted as a snapshot of a moment in time, with the green representing the peaceful and idyllic nature of the golf course.
