This vase may represent love and affection. The roses are probably symbolic of the love between the two people depicted in the painting, and the chrysanthemums may represent the affection between the two. The green foliage and abundance of flowers in the vase may also suggest a sense of fertility and life. The calmly poised figures and the carefully rendered brushstrokes give this piece a feeling of peaceful serenity. The subdued colors may symbolize the inevitability of change, and the ethereal quality of the painting lends this image a mysterious quality. The painting could also be interpreted as a metaphor for the peace and tranquility that comes with being in touch with one's own inner emotions.
