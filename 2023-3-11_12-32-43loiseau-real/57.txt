The subject is probably Anthony van Dyck, who was a portraitist in the Golden Age of Painting. The old man has a thoughtful and calm expression, with finely-drawn features and sparse hair on his head, which is reminiscent of the Renaissance style. Van Dyck was known for his masterful use of light and shadow to convey character and emotion, and it is likely that he used these techniques to create the nuanced portrait of the old man. This particular portrait is thought to be a self-portrait, and it is likely that Van Dyck used light and shadow to create the illusion of depth and movement on the face.
