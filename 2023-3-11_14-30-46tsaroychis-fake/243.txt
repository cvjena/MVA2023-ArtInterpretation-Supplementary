In this painting, the Virgin Mary is looking down at the Christ Child, who is lying on her lap. She has a serene expression on her face, and the child appears to be surrounded by a halo of light. The Virgin and Child are flanked by two small angels, who are flying towards the child. This painting is influenced by Byzantine art and is thought to have been created for a church. The angels may represent the saintly protectors of the child. The background is dominated by a deep blue, which may represent the sky on a good day. This painting is a contemplation of the divine, and it may be used as a background for a religious painting.
