This painting is a deep, dark brown with shades of black. It shows the very beginning of humanity, when Adam and Eve are just starting to eat from the Forbidden Tree of Knowledge. They are surrounded by animals, but the serpent is the most recognizable. The serpent is coiled around a tree with ribs visible, hinting at the dangers of knowledge. The couple is shown looking cautiously in all directions, as if they are curious but also worried. The painting is a powerful representation of the beginning of human sin. It is a reminder that we are all still, despite the darkness that we are surrounded by.  There are many possible interpretations of any painting, but the above are just a few.
