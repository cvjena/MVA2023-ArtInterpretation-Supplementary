The painting depicts a bouquet of flowers, with a bright blue sky in the background. The flowers are arranged in a vase, and are displayed so as to capture the viewer's attention. The use of light and shadow is very expert, and allows the flowers to stand out from the background. This is a very creative piece, and it depicts a sense of orientalism. It could be interpreted as a celebration of life, or as a meditation on the beauty and fragility of life. The flowers might represent the idea of self-awareness, and the blue sky could represent the sky of life. It could be seen as a symbol of the infinite.
