In this painting, we see a woman seated who is holding her right leg in her hand. Her face is shown in profile, and her expression is closed off, seeming to be in deep thought. The woman's dress is fitted tightly around her body, highlighting her curves and hinting at the secrets beneath. She is surrounded by a bright light that casts shadows on her face, lending a shadowy texture to the portrait. This somber and intimate painting could represent Schiele's unhappy marriage to his wife, who apparently paintings very differently than he does. She may be expressing her feelings on the sitter's behalf, or she may simply be relaxed and at peace.
