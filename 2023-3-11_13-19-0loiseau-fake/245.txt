This portrait may depict the artist's beloved sister. With its soft, creamy tones and tranquil, serene expression, the portrait may remind the viewer of a more tender, vulnerable side of the artist. The setting looks like a comfortable bedroom, complete with a bed and a few pieces of furniture. The light entering from the window casts a warm glow on the features of the sitter. Valerie Neuzil may have been born into privilege, but it is clear that she embraced her sense of individuality and embraced her artistry. This is a portrait of a highly talented artist who has helped to inspire others, whether it be to inspiration himself or to serve others.
