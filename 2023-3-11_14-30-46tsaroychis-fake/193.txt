This painting is a depiction of the Holy Family, with Mary as the primary figure. She is looking down at her infant son, Christ, while Joseph stands behind her, protectively holding her right elbow. Christ is posed realistically, with a gentleexpression on his face. The light reflections off of Joseph's turquoise robe add an element of depth and color to the image. This painting is predominantly green, symbolizing the environment in which the family lived and the fertility of the land. The blue in the background represents the ocean, which is a common theme in Sargent's work.
