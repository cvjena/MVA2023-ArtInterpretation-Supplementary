In this painting, Rembrandt captures an individual who is focused and intent, thinking deeply about their own life. They are wearing a high-collared dress (representing high status and importance), which accentuates the dignified 370 look they are giving off. The Beret they are wearing, along with the positioning of their head, gives the impression of someone who is strategizing and planning. They have a serious expression on their face, and the highlights in their hair and on their forehead give the impression of deep thought. The use of light and shadow gives the painting a three dimensional quality, making the subject feel more alive. This painting is a great example of the Dutch Golden Age, which was a time of great change for Dutch society.
