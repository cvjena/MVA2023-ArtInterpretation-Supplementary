This painting is composed of overlapping circles, rectangles and ovals. The shapes are painted in such a way that they create the illusion of a tumultuous and chaotic river. The dark tones in the painting depict the dirty and turbulent water, while the light tones show the reflection of the sky and the shore. The composition has a chaotic, unkempt feeling, which is fitting for a painting representing a turbulent river. The subject matter could be interpreted in a variety of ways, but one possibility is that it is a metaphor for the artist's life at the time, which was tumultuous and full of turmoil. The swirls of color could also represent the chaotic emotions he was experiencing at the time.
