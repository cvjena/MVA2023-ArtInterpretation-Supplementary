Dante and Virgil descend into the inferno, guided by an angel. They see the people who have sinned the most severely being tortured in various ways. People in the lower levels of the inferno are being burned alive while people in the upper levels are being frozen in masses of ice. The grim and grotesque imagery in this canto provides a visual representation of the magnitude of sin. The dragon is a symbol of evil and justice, while the hell is a place of great torment. The image could be interpreted as a warning to the people about the dangers of sin and the consequences of sin-filled behavior. The flames rising from the sinners represents the sin of their lives.
