This painting depicts a wheat field at harvest time. The ripe wheat is a deep, rich green, and the stalks are tall and sturdy, with a reddish sheen from the sun. In the distance, you can see the tips of the wooded hills, and a fairy-tale castle can be seen in the distance, beautifully bathed in the late afternoon sun. This is a beautiful painting of a peaceful time, when the land was fertile and the people were content. This painting is possible because it is a religious painting, depicting the biblical story of Noah's Ark. The sky is overcast, and there is a storm brewing in the distance.
