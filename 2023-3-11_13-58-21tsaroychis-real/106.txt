This painting is a view of the River Seine in France. The boats are brightly painted, and there is a beautiful sun setting in the background. One possible interpretation of the painting is that the artist was painting a cheerful image of the regatta to show the people of France that life goes on despite the war. The boats could also be a symbol of hope, as they represent the community that is going to war. The sun also seems to be shining brightly in the background, giving the image a festive feel. This could be an interpretation of the artist's optimism about the future of France, or his hope that the people of France will enjoy their lives despite the war.
