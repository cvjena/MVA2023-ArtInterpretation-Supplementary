This painting is one in a series of nudes that Lapicque created while living in Rome in the late 1950s. Lapicque was interested in the human form as an essential part of the landscape, using light and shadow to create depth and illusion. The figure is depicted in profile, with strong angular lines that delineate the contours of the body. The stark white background highlights the tanned skin, and dark shadows create a sense of deep space underneath the figure. The painting may represent the deep thoughts and contemplative moments of the artist. It may also be interpreted as a snapshot of a moment in time, capturing the fleeting beauty of a moment.
