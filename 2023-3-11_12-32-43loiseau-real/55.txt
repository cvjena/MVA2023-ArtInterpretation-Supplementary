This painting portrays a wealthy, old man named Jacques Le Roy. The face is heavy with age, and the eyes appear watery and sad. Van Dyck was known for his precision and mastery of detail, and he shows homosexual love in the character's long, curly light auburn hair. The clothing is very elaborate and symbolic, and may have referenced aspects of the coming season. Van Dyck likely created this portrait as a memorial to Jacques Le Roy, one of the earliest recorded gay men in European history. It would be a timeless portrait that reflects Van Dyck's enduring love for Le Roy.
