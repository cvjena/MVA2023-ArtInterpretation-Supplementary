The painting depicts a scene from Russian history. In Surikov's time, the Russian Empire was expanding and annexing lands from its neighbors. This could be seen in the painting as a group of men, surrounding a woman on her knees. The woman is wearing a traditional Russian dress, and has her hands tied behind her back. This could suggest that she is being held captive or subjected to some kind of assault. The painting also features a few horses and cannon, which could suggest that this is a battle scene. Alternatively, this could be seen as a representation of the Russian aristocracy, as the woman in the painting is wearing a very expensive dress. This could suggest that she is a wealthy member of the aristocracy, or someone of importance.
