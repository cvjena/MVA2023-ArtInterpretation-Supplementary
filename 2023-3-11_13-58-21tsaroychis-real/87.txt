This painting depicts a pastoral scene of rolling hills in the distance and a small building on the right. Nearby, there is a tree with a flock of Ibises perched on its branches. The landscape is beautifully rendered and provides a tranquil backdrop for the figures. Sargent captures the natural beauty of Grasse and its environs in this painting. The muted colors give the scene a serene mood, and the soft, blowing light gives the impression of a calm and peaceful evening. The painting could also be interpreted as a portrayal of the artist's love life, with the lush greenery in the background and the soaring cliffs in the foreground.
