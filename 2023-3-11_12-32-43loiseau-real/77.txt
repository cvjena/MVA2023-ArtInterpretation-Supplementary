The painting is of a dignified older gentleman with a goatee and mustache, wearing a long dress and ornate golden necklace and earrings. He is seated in a lavish chair, with his hand resting on an inkstand that is decorated with a peacock feather. Behind him is a view of a classical palace, with tall columns and a large dome. Bronzino probably painted this work in the early 1540s, during the height of the Florentine Renaissance. He was a highly skilled painter, known for his masterful portrayal of human emotions and his sophisticated portrayal of Classical art and architecture. This painting could be interpreted as a representation of the power and majesty of the Roman Empire.
