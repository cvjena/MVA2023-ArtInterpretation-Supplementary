This painting is of an old, gnarled tree with deep roots. Its trunk is large and bulbous, with rough, weathered bark. The branches are long and spindly, ending in drooping leaves. The leaves are a deep green, the color of fresh rain after a long drought. In the background, you can see the faint outline of a hill, and the sky is a deep blue. The painting is full of life, with the leaves rustling in the wind and the roots kneading the earth. This seems to be a picture of the sadness that Vincent Van Gogh felt at the time he painted it, as the tree represents ancient wisdom and life.
