The painting is set against a stark white backdrop and depicts a barren winter landscape. The snow-covered ground, barren trees and sharp edges of the rocks create a harsh and uninviting environment. The dark sky contains a hint of light and suggests the possibility of hope. The bleakness of the landscape is contrasted by the bright blue of the water, which makes the painting look peaceful and tranquil. The coastline in the distance is visible, providing a natural setting for the barren figure of the man in the center. This painting could symbolize the strength and hope of the natural world. The starkness of the landscape could also be interpreted as a metaphor for the human condition, which is full of pain and suffering.
