This painting is a representation of the three theological virtues. Faith, hope, and love. Faith is represented by the infant Christ who is holding a Cross and is flanked by the Madonna and Saint John the Evangelist. Hope is represented by the angel standing behind the Madonna and Saint John. Love is represented by the couple clasping their hands. Love is represented by the couple with their hands outstretched. This painting is a beautiful depiction of the three virtues and it would be a perfect addition to any home. It is a sure sign of the salvation that will come. This painting is a great reminder of the importance of faith, how it can bring happiness and hope, and the importance of having loved ones around in difficult times.
