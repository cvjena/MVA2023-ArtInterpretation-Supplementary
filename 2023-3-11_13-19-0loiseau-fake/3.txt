This painting depicts one of the most famous canals in Venice, situated in the international district of Santa Croce. The canalside is full of boats and people, as evidenced by the many figures visible on the boats and the people on the shore. The canalscape is dominated by a spectacular architecture, including the Basilica di San Marco and the Doges' Palace. This painting was created in 1907, shortly before Boccioni's death at the age of 27. The canalscape features many boats and people, but there is the occasional depiction of the cathedral canals.
