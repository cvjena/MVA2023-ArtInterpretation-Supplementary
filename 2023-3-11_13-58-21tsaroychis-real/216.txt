This painting portrays Admiral Augustus Keppel, the first Earl of Albemarle, as he would have appeared during the early 1750s. Reynolds is considered one of the most talented portrait painters in history, and his portraits reflect his remarkable aesthetic sense and skill as a draughtsman. Keppel was a determined and successful naval commander who played a major role in the British victory in the War of Jenkins' Ear (1739-1748). He served as First Lord of the Admiralty (1748-1754) and as Governor of Gibraltar (1755-1758).- Reynolds captures the judgment of God, the messenger of the universe, with his artful use of color and shading.
