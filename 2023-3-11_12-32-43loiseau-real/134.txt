This painting is a religious allegory about the Archangel Gabriel who, according to Christian theology, brings news of Jesus's birth to the Virgin Mary. The painting is dominated by a large, pure white angel, flanked by smaller angels. The angel's wings are spread out in a posture of supplication, while the light streaming from the Christ child casts a soft glow over the angels. The background is a deep blue, evoking the infinite sky. This painting is a beautiful example of Dore's skill as a painter of light and shadow. The angel's wings may be seen as a metaphor for the peace and serenity that comes from knowing and understanding complex knowledge.
