What stands out most to the viewer is his nose, which is unusually large and prominent. Jakobides was known for his portraits of powerful Greek individuals in the late 1800s and early 1900s. This painting could be interpreted as a portrayal of a wealthy, wealthy man influence in the man's life. The prominent clothing and ornate details in the background could be a reflection of the man's wealth and status.
