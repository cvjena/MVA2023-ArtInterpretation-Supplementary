This painting is a riot of color and it is difficult to determine where one color ends and another begins. The background is a bluish green with a yellowish tinge and there are bright stripes of red, yellow, orange, and green running across the canvas. Extremely busy brushstrokes are used to create this tangled web of colors. The woman depicted might be a seamstress or a woman who trades in various marketplaces and the painting might depict her everyday life. She could be a loving wife and sister, friend or friend. This is a very complex and intricate piece that could be interpreted in many ways. It could be symbolic of the artist's own life, family, or work.
