This painting is a representation of the early morning hours, when the sun is just starting to rise and the world is just starting to wake. The green of the grass, the pink of the flowers, and the yellow of the light all combine to create a beautiful image. The light shines from the left and gives the impression of a glow, while the light from the right illuminates the door and the cupboard. It seems like a harmonious scene, and it would make a great addition to any home.  There are many different interpretations that could be given to these paintings, as the artist's intent is always a mystery.
