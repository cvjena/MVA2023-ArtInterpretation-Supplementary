This painting is a study of a human head. The eyes, eyebrows and hair are finely drawn and painted with great attention to detail. The skin appears almost luminous. The features are classic, with a strong chin and a natural expression. The man appears to be in his early twenties and might be Russian. He might be a peasant or a clergyman. He might be looking off to the distance, contemplating life or looking at something in the distance. The painting is peaceful and serene, and would be a great choice for a room that is meant to reflect simple life.  There are many possible interpretations of a painting, as the artist intended it to be interpreted in a particular way.
