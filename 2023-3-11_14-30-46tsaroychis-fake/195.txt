This painting portrays the Madonna and Child as if they are looking down upon the viewer. The Madonna has a serene expression, while the Child looks up at her with wonder. The child's messy hair and clothing gives him the appearance of being a Local child that has not been well groomed, which gives the painting an authentic feeling. This was an original Commedia dell'Arte performance, and the static poses, static backgrounds, and dark colors are all reminiscent of traditional Commedia dell'Arte masks and scenes. This could be interpreted as a representation of the Madonna and Child's inner life, and how they are constantly learning and growing.
