The work is composed of charcoal and white, on which is a black figure against a white background. The figure is a woman, reclining on a bed with her head resting on her hand. She is partially veiled, and her face is in shadows. Behind her, a column with a sparkle is visible. It is possible that this painting is a depiction of a love story, with the woman as the vampiric figure, representing the light of love, and the sparkle representing the guidance and strength of love. The shadowy figure could represent the veil of secrecy that secrecy brings, and the bright light representing the love that the woman is seeking.
