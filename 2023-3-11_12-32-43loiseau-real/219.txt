This is a painting that depicts a scene from the Hindu epic, the Mahabharata. It shows the Kiranagara palace in the distance, and the green landscape around it. The painting is full of bright colors, and the kiranagara in the foreground is standing out against the green. The painting might be interpreted as a celebration of the triumph of life over death. The palace might represent the power of the aristocracy over the power of the Kiranagara palace, and the landscape might represent the green of the fields around the Kiranagara palace. The painting might also be interpreted as a commentary on the transient nature of life. Kiranagara rises from the dead, and the people around him mourn his death.
