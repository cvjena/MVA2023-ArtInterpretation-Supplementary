This painting is a portrait of Rembrandt's son-in-law Nicolas Bruyningh. Nicolas is shown wearing a high-collared coat and a wide-brimmed hat, as well as a sly, complacent expression. The light shining on his face and the sharpness of his features give him an air of distinction and power.  This painting could be interpreted as a portrait of someone who is confident and comfortable in their own skin, someone who is powerful and in control. The painting is also a reflection of Rembrandt's own position as an accomplished artist and businessman. He is known for his successful paintings of aristocrats and business people, and this painting is no exception.
