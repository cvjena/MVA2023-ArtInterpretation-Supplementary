This painting is about the Annunciation. The angel guard standing in the background is Elisha with a flambeau, hinting at the approaching dawn. In the foreground is the Virgin Mary, with Jesus prostrate in her lap, and Saint Anne in the background. Saint Anne is holding the baby Jesus Christ. Saint Eligius is looking on from the left and Saint George is looking on from the right. This painting shows the three main branches of the Catholic Church: the Latin, the Eastern Orthodox, and the Oriental Orthodox.       This painting could be interpreted as a three-dimensional scene of the Madonna and Child. Saint George is looking down on the infant Jesus,azoning him as the new savior.
