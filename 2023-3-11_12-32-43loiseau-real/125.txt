The portrait is of a man in his 60s with a long beard. He is wearing a high-collared, long-sleeved gown with a fur-lined hood. He has a regal appearance and his features are delicate, with a long nose and wide eyes. He might be an official of some kind, or perhaps he is a monk. Hans Holbein must have been very pleased with the final result because the portrait has survived for over 500 years. He was a very skilled painter and this is an excellent example of his work. One possible interpretation is that he captured the essence of the subject, particularly his proud attire and striking facial features.
