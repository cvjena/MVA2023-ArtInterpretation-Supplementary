In the painting, an aging actor is seen reflecting on his life and what he has done. Highlights in his hair and beard hint at the years of his life that have passed, while the wrinkles around his eyes tell the story of his emotions. He is clad in a traditional performative kimono, symbolic of the role he has played in this world. Behind him is a curtain, concealing the backstage area where he has spent his life. This could be seen as a metaphor for the veil of secrecy that surrounds us and our private thoughts. The expression on his face is one of deep reflection and contemplation, capturing the emotions of his life. He has betrayed his family and tarnished the reputation of this statue.
