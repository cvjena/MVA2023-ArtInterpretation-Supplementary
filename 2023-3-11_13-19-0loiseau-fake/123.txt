In this painting, the viewer is looking out past a wood at a vista of rolling countryside. Because of the massing of trees on the horizon, this is probably a fairly rural location. The painting is composed of densely painted brushstrokes, giving the impression of a natural landscape. The sky is a brilliant blue and the sun is shining brightly. The trees are a lush green, giving the painting a broad appeal. Combined with the bright blue sky, this could be seen as a appealing image for the viewer to enjoy. The painting is a timeless representation of the natural world, which could be seen as a metaphor for the beauty and peace of the pastoral lifestyle.
