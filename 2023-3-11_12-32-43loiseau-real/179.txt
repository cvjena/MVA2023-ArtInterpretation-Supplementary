The painting is a canvas of pure white on which are painted three symmetrical concentric circles, each brightly colored. In the center of the circle is a large red sun. The background is an iridescent blue, and the circles are surrounded by a lattice of rainbow-colored filaments. The painting could symbolize the eternal cycle of life, or the creative power of the artist. It could also be interpreted as a representation of the Russian Monarchy, with the red sun representing the czar, and the blue background representing the ocean. The artist's use of light and color is masterfully executed. This painting could be seen as a representation of the artist's life and work.
