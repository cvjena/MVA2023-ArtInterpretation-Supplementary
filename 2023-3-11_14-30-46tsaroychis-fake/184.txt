This painting portrays a young man who is caught in the act of committing an act of violence. He has a look of utmost hatred and fury on his face as he forcefully stabs another man. The bloodied victim is half-layed on the ground, already dead, while the young man stands over him, ready to carry out his vicious attack. This scene could be a portrait of someone who is deeply in conflict with their own emotions, perhaps experiencing rage and violence on a continuous basis. The background is dominated by a dark, ominous sky, hinting at the intense emotions of the protagonist. The muted colors and heavy lines create a very somber and dark atmosphere.
