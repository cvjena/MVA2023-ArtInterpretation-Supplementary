The portrait is of a distinguished-looking man with a severe expression. He might be a statesman or perhaps a businessman. His costume is sober, with a high collar and a long, full coat. In his left hand he holds a quill, possibly signifying his profession as a writer. The light behind him casts a halo around his head, giving the impression of an aura of authority and power. The background is largely featureless, but hints of red and green can be seen in the drapery and on the figures. The painting could be interpreted as a portrait of a man of prominence and experience, who has seen a lot in his life.
