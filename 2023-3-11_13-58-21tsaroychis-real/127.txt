The viewer is looking out over a beautiful coastline, with rocky cliffs on one side and the sea on the other. There's a feeling of peace and serenity in the image, thanks to the muted colors and blending of the different elements. The horizon looks like it's gently swelling and gradually blending into the sea, which creates a sense of depth.   The painting is a metaphor for the union of two strange and beautiful halves of the world. It could be interpreted as a snapshot of a moment in time, or as a symbol of the spiritual connection between all people. The painting could also be interpreted as a commentary on the unequal distribution of power in the world, or on the relationship between people and nature.
