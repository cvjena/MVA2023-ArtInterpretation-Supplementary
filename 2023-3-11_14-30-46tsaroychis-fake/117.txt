This painting depicts a tranquil scene of the Seine River at Argenteuil, near Paris. The morning sun casts a warm glow over the lower areas of the painting and illuminates the trees and the landscape in the distance. In the foreground, floating on the gentle current, is a small pleasure yacht, with people on board looking out at the river. The painting is a beautiful example of Monet's Impressionist style, with intense colors and realistic details.  There are many interpretations of paintings, some more specific than others. A skilled art historian would be able to provide a more detailed interpretation of a painting, tailored specifically to the observer.
