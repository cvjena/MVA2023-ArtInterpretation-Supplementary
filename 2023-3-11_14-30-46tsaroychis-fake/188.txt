Durer's composition is based on sixteenth century Italian paintings of the Crucifixion and was created for the Cross Gallery in Nuremberg. The painting is a complex work, utilizing a panoramic view to show the Golgotha – or the place of the Crucifixion – from a variety of angles. The viewer stands in the lower left corner of the painting, just as Jesus falls to his death. The body hangs from the crossbeam, surrounded by soldiers, administrators and onlookers. A possible interpretation could be that the painting represents theVarious social layers that were present at the time of the Crucifixion, including the religious hierarchy.
