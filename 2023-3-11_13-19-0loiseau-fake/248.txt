The painting is a recreation of a portrait that was evidently owned by N.P. Chernyshova, who was also the sitter's first cousin. She is depicted wearing a high-necked, lace-edged dress and her head is adorned with a gauzy lace veil. Her blemished complexion suggests that she may have been ill at the time the portrait was painted. She seems to be studying the viewer with a penetrating gaze, expressing an intensity of emotion with the use of just a few brushstrokes.   A possible interpretation of this painting could be that it is a portrayal of Chernyshova as an intelligent, cultured woman who is striking in her appearance.
