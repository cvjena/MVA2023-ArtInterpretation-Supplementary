In this painting, the artist portrays himself twice - once as he sees himself and once as he sees the viewer. In his self-portrait, he is posing naked, displaying his muscular body and striking facial features. His skin is dark, almost black, contrasting starkly with his blond hair. He is looking directly at the viewer, his eyes piercing into your soul. Yet in the lower half of the painting, Schiele portrays himself from the perspective of the viewer, looking straight out from the canvas. He is standing slightly behind the main figure, and his body is partially obscured by the shadow of the person behind him. This dual perspective speaks to the duality of the human experience, the dichotomy of our inner and outer selves.
