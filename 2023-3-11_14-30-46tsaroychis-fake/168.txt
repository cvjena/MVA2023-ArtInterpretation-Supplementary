This abstract painting is predominantly blue, with swirls and strokes that give the appearance of water droplets or waves. The blue seems to be in contrast with the darker areas of the painting, which could suggest that the lighter area represents the sky or heavens, while the darker areas may represent the earth or underworld. The painting could also be interpreted as a metaphor for the different aspects of life - water for the life of the earth, life of the flowers and earth for the atmosphere. The swirls and lines in the painting could represent movement or energy, while the blue could be interpreted as representing the sky or heavens. Alternatively, the painting could be interpreted as a metaphor for the different ages of life - the past, the present and the future.
