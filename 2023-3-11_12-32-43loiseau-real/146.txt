The painting depicts a scene from the life of Saint Peter from the Bible, in which he preaches the Conversion of Emperor Constantine. The saint is shown in a conical Romanesque hat, preaching to a crowd of pagans with a mighty voice. The scene is set against a Ruined Castle in the backdrop, which could represent the emperor's powerlessness to resist Saint Peter's teachings. Dore's famous illustration is an iconic representation of the power of Christianity and its ability to convert even the most stubborn of hearts. The dramatic composition, with thechuided castle in the background and the emperor's troops in the foreground, highlights the importance of this moment in history.
