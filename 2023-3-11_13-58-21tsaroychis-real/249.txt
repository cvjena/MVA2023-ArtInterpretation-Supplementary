Kirchner's painting features two women sitting in a garden. One woman has her hand resting on her chin, while the other holds a book. They both appear to be looking straight ahead. The colors in the painting are muted, with a light blue sky and a darker gray earth in the background. The women's faces are mostly hidden by their clothing, but glimpses of the flowers and trees give the impression of depth and detail. Kirchner was a master at capturing the expressions of his women, and this painting is a excellent example of his skill. This painting could be interpreted as a portrayal of the peace and tranquility that can be found in nature.
