This painting depicts the beautiful Himalayas backdrop, with the peaks in the distance and the rivers flowing in all directions. The colors are muted and natural, with shades of blue, green, and brown. It looks as if the mountains are reaching up towards the sky, creating a mesmerizing and Sleeping Beauty-like atmosphere. This could be seen as a representation of the artist's own spiritual journey, or of the journey of humanity itself. The painting could also be interpreted as a meditation on the spiritual side of life. In particular, the deepiance in the foreground could be seen as a representation of the infinite potential that exists within all of us, as well as a reminder of the infinite potential that can be created through hard work.
