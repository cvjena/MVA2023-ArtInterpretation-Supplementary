This painting is a depiction of biblical story of Joseph, who flees to Egypt to avoid imprisonment by his brother, Potiphar. While in Egypt, Joseph becomes a protecting agent for the Pharaoh’s wife, who has been falsely accused of sexual impropriety by her husband. Joseph eventually becomes second in command to the Pharaoh.  This painting depicts the story from the wife’s point of view. She is laying on the bed, surrounded by servants, gazing hopefully at the door. She is worried about Joseph and her heart is clearly in the right place. The background is a mixture of browns, tans, and greys, with light shining through the window.
