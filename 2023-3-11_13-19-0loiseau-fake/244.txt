This painting is of a young woman sitting on a sofa, with her feet up on the armrest and her hands resting in her lap. She appears to be lost in thought, or perhaps daydreaming. The soft light thrown by the lamp on the far wall casts a warm glow on her face, and appears to bring out the beauty of her features. She appears to be in her early 20s, and is wearing a casual dress. This painting could be interpreted as a portrayal of a young woman who is confident and comfortable in her own skin. It could also be interpreted as a portrait of the artist's own wife or girlfriend.
