The painting is composed of a blue field with a group of trees in the center. The viewer can see the outlines of the trees and the stretching out of the field. The trees seem to be reaching up towards the sky, as if they are looking for something. The background is a deep blue, and the painting has a calm, peaceful feeling. This could be a painting of contemplation or nature in a tranquil setting. The trees could represent the strength and endurance of the natural world, and the setting of the painting could suggest the beauty of rural life. The trees could also represent the inclusion of the human soul in the eternal cycle of life and death. The painting could be a metaphor for the journey of life.
