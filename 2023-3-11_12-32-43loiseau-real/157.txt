This painting is all about posture and the way people do with their time. The old man is sitting in a longset chair, with his back to the viewer. He is wearing a dress and a conical hat, and he is staring straight ahead. The young man is sitting in front of him, looking down. He has a moment of reflection, and he seems to be sad or weary. The painting is muted in color, because the old man is the only character in the painting. He is blended in with the surrounding darkness, and he is the only color that stands out. He is the only person in the painting, and he is the only person that the artist created inordinately depth.
