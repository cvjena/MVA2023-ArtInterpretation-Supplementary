This oil on canvas depicts a bucolic scene. To the right is a forest, to the left a river. In the center is a manor house with a large garden. A horse and a rider are travelling across the countryside. The boyarynia, or chestnut tree, is a symbol of peace and serenity. It is possible to think of this painting as a symbol of Makovsky's home country, Ukraine, and its natural beauty. The painting could also be seen as a metaphor for the peace and tranquility that can be found in nature. The painter used a muted palette to create a sense of peace and tranquility. He used a lot of light and shadow to create an illusion of depth.
