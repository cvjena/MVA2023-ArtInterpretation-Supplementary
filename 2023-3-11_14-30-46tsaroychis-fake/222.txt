This sculpture is composed of two sections, the upper being a nude female figure and the lower a chair. From the front, the female figure dominates the composition, her voluptuous body stretched out in a languid pose. The pose suggests that the woman has just awakened, her eyes still closed and her mouth slightly open, her breasts gathered together suggestively. The intense color and intricate detail of the sculpture make it an impressive sight. In terms of meaning, it is possible to read the sculpture as an expression of feminine power and powerlessness. The woman appears to be in control of the situation, but she is also defenseless, vulnerable and exposed. This could be a commentary on the power dynamics of society at the time.
