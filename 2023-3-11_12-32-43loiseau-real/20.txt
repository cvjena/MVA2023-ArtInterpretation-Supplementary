The flowers in this painting are delicate, with petals that seem to be splayed out. The tobacco pot is on the bottom right, and it has a lid that is open, exposing the glazed interior. The plants and the pot are placed in front of a glowing background, which gives the painting an illuminated feel. This could represent the beauty of life, or the warmth of a fire, or simply the goodness of nature. The flowers could also represent the Dutch countryside and the colors that are used in its culture. They could be symbolic of the country's beauty, or of the different aspects of life. Alternatively, they could be representing the artist's passion, smoking a pipe.
