This painting features the angel Gabriel, who interrupts the Annunciation angel to tell Mary that she is going to be a mother. The Annunciation angel is depicted as a young woman, with an extraordinarily beautiful face, and Gabriel looks considerably older, with a more severe, commanding demeanor. Gabriel is shown with a furrowed brow, signifying his intense concentration on the task at hand. The background of the painting is dominated by a deep blue, symbolizing heaven, while the angel's white robes and elegant headdress are brightly illuminated.
