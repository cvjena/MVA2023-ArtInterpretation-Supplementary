This painting depicts a pastoral landscape with a river meandering its way through the center of the picture. The rolling hills and trees are reminiscent of a verdant and golden countryside. The alluring colors of the landscape set the tone for a softly romantic scene. The deer in the distance seems to be grazing peacefully in the meadow, while a couple walking in the distance seem to be enjoying the view. This painting could be interpreted as a representation of the artist's own life, as he was born and grew up in a rural area. The peaceful and idyllic scene could be a reminder of the author's happy memories.
