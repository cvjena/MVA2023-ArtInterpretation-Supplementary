This painting is a detailed depiction of three women at a market stall. They are all wearing clothes that suggest they are buying goods for sale. The painting is set against a brightly-colored background, with the women appearing to be in a lively, happy mood. The women are facing the viewer and have their heads tilted to the side, giving the impression that they are waiting for something. This is a realistic painting, with the details of the clothing and the background. It could be interpreted as a depiction of the life of a middle-class family in the 1920s, or it could be seen as a reflection of the way people in that era lived their lives.
