This painting features a farm surrounded by expansive fields, and a solitary tree in the center. The predominant color in the painting is blue, which would reflect the sky and sea nearby. The blue is not just a color on the canvas, but is also in the sky and the water. The tree is the only other object in the painting, and it is in a deep green color, which would show the contrast with the other colors. The painting is peaceful and calming, and it would be perfect for a room that is used for relaxation or for those who appreciate nature's beauty.  There are many possible interpretations of paintings, but the artist could be representing a single emotion or idea in any given painting.
