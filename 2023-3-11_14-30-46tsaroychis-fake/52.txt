This painting portrays a woman in profile, her hair tumbled down around her shoulders, gazing off into the distance. She may be contemplating a far-away place, or she may be looking at a loved one. The deep blue of the sky and the reflections of the nearby landscape give the painting a depth and mystery that is captivating. The woman's posture is delicate, she seems to be holding something in her hand, and she may be holding a bouquet of flowers. This painting could represent the artist's love for women, and his desire to hold your attention long enough to see if they are happy. The painting could also be interpreted as a symbol of purity or innocence.
