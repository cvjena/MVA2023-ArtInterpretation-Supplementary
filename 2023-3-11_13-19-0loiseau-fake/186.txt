This painting portrays a boat landing in the middle of a storm. The boat has just come in to shore, and the wash from the boat is spreading out in all directions. The waves are high and the wind is blowing fiercely. The horizon is very dark, and the only lights are the lights from the boat and the lamps on the pier. The painting may be symbolic of the difficulties and dangers of life, or it may be a celebration of the beach and the beauty of the storm. The painting may also be a comment on the fragility of life, and the way that technology can take over. The waves are very strong, and the water is very murky.
