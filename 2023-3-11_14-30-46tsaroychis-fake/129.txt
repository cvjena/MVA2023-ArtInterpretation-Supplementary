The tree is in the center of the painting and dominates all of the space around it. The trunk and branches are thick and strong, with some strips of bark sticking out. The leaves are large and grouped together in clusters, giving the tree a appear of mass and strength. The sky is blue, and the sun is shining brightly. The tree is a natural focal point, and the colors around it are used to give the viewer a sense of depth. The painting is mysterious and calming, and would be perfect for a living room or bedroom.   This painting could be interpreted as a symbol of strength and power, of the natural world and the human race.
