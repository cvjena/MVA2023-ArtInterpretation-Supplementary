This painting is a depressing scene with a lone figure walking through the center of the canvas. There is a sense of sadness and loss in the atmosphere, as can be seen in the tired and bedraggled figures, the desolate landscape around the figure, and the perspective that the figure is walking on. This painting could be interpreted as a commentary on the state of Armenia at the time, as the country is in turmoil. The painting could also be seen as a representation of the isolation and loneliness that people feel in this world. The bright colors used in this painting could be seen as a symbol of hope and optimism, though it is also possible to see the bleakness in the depiction of the battlefield in the background.
