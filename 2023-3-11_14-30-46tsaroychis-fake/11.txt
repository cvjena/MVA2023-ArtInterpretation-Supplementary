The painting is composed of a bright spectrum of colors, from ultraviolet to infrared. This wide range of colors is commonly used in paintings to signify different emotions. For example, red often signifies passion, orange signifies excitement, yellow signifies happiness, and blue signifies calm.  The painting is based on the idea of opposites. On the left side is a scene of darkness and despair, while on the right side is a scene of light and happiness. This is indicative of the dichotomy of human life, which is often characterized by moments of great happiness and joy, and moments of darkness and despair. However, on the right side is a scene of light and happiness, which signifies the possibility for hope and progress.
