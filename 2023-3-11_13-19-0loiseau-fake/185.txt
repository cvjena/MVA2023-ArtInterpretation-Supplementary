This painting is a seascape, typical in color and composition of the painter's pre-war period. The leaden sky is heavy with clouds, and the sea looks menacing and deceptive. The painting's centerpiece is the ship, sailing majestically towards the viewer with its clustering masts. The rest of the canvas is taken up with rugged shoreline, crashing waves, and sparse islands. Segal was likely referencing Biblical scenes in his paintings, and this image may depict aspects of a journey to the Promised Land. The ships in the painting may represent travel and progress, and the ships in the background may represent the journey of life.
