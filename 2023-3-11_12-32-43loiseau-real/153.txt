The tumultuous sky is a deep blue with deep blacks, while the land beneath is a mix of greens and browns. The viewer can see rolling hills, trees, and a river in the distance. The brushstrokes in the sky and on the ground are bold and swirling, and create an impression of movement. The artist may have been depicting a storm underway. The storm could be a reference to the World War I which was happening at that time. The artist could be representing the dark side of human nature, the destructive one that can lead to tragedy. The artist may be warning people to be careful though, as the storm could be destructive.
