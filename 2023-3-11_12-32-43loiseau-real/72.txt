The painting is of a distinguished looking man with a stern expression. He may represent a statesman or lawyer, and has a dashing mustache and a trimmed beard. He seems to be wearing a finely crafted suit and is possibly holding a book or papers. The background could be a room in a high-rise building, with a view out over the cityscape below. This could be a depiction of the man's aspirations or the power he has acquired as a lawyer and politician. The use of light and shadow give the painting a depth and dimension, making it appear even more imposing. The man's features are difficult to make out, but his facial expression and clothing might suggest that he is angry or upset.
