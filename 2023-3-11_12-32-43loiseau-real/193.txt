Jan Matejko's painting of Darius I, using a light color palette, portrays the central figure in the act of lending money. The lending is seen as a moral lesson for the Greeks, as the central figure is clearly a proud and confident one. The lending is also seen as a metaphor for the Greeks' hope for a better future. The background is sparse, with just a few promissions in hand, lending a sense of calm and stability to the painting. The lending of money is a metaphor for the prosperity and strength of the Greeks, and the nation-state that formed the framework of their empire.
