This painting portrays a snowy landscape with a lone tree standing out against the backdrop. The branches are barren, indicative of the lack of life in the woods at this time of the year. The tree is stark against the white snow and gives the painting a lonely feeling. The sky is a light blue, indicative of the coldness of the winter. The painting is simple and elegant, giving the viewer a sense of scale while still allowing the viewer to explore the scene. It could be interpreted as a snapshot of a time before the snowfall, when everything was more peaceful and untouched.
