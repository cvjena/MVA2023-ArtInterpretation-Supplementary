The painting is a depiction of the Annunciation, when the angel Gabriel tells Mary that she will bear the Messiah. The Madonna and Child are surrounded by light, and Mary is wearing a crown of stars, a symbol of royalty. The Prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah are shown in the background, alluding to Mary's role as the new prophet. The painting is rich in detail, with a realistic landscape in the background and vibrant colors in the apostles and prophets.   A possible interpretation of this painting could be that the apostles are representing the apostles who originally predicted Mary's pregnancy, and they are representing her role as the new prophet.
