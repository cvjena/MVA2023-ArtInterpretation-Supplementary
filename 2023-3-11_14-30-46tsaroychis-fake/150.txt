The painting is set at the winter solstice, when the days are shortest and the nights longest. A dark, icy sky stretches over a frigid landscape, with a solitary tree standing strong in the middle of it all. The tree's barren branches reach up towards the sky, reaching for the scant vestiges of light that remain. As the days grow longer and the sun begins to climb again, the tree begins to sprout new leaves, symbolizing the hope for a new season. The stillness of the landscape is almost eerie, and the only sound that can be heard is the song of the trees.
