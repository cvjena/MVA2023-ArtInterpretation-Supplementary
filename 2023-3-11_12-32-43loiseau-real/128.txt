The painting is a tribute to the Russian Revolution and its martyrs. Peter, the Apostle of Humanity, is depicted as a grieving, tormented figure. He is reeling from the emotional wounds inflicted on him by the revolutionaries, and kneels shattered, trying to come to terms with the terrible losses he has suffered. The bright colors of the mural suggest a utopian world that has been torn apart, and the reversed Sterling Silver attributes of the figures eloquently communicate the anguish of the moment. Theeline Rose, who was also a very prominent figure in the painting, is depicted as a softer, more spiritual figure, resigned to her fate. She is clad in a plain dress, and her hair is pulled back in a bun.
