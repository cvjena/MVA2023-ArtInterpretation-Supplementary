The painting is comprised of a forest of tall trees, with the sun setting in the sky behind the trees. The trees are densely packed together, and the leaves of the trees are on the lower parts of the painting, giving the viewer a sense of depth. The green of the leaves is a deep blue, and the blacks in the painting give the impression of depth. The painting is peaceful and stunning, and would be perfect for a room that you want to make a strong statement about yourself. The painting could be interpreted as a metaphor for the power and strength of nature, and how it can bring peace and solace to people.
