This painting is a nude female in the center of the painting. Her skin is light and her body is seemingly Drapery free. Her hands are raised up in a gesture of prayer, and she looks out at the viewer with a sense of peace and nobility. The clothing of the day would've covered and obscured a lot more of her body, so the fact that her modesty is preserved in the painting is a beautiful reminder of the importance of modesty in all aspects of life. The background behind her is filled with a bank of clouds, a perfect symbol of the weather. This painting is a reminder of the peace and tranquility that can be found in theesthetic and natural surroundings.
