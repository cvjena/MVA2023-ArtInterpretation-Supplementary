This oil painting features a religious figure, usually associated with charity and piety, who appears¬—depending on the viewer's perspective—to be at the mercy of the forces of sin and decay. Powerful, flowing lines accentuate the figure's sweeping gestures, while a cloak and apron flow in the background. Colors are muted, oneself toward the end of the painting, giving the impression that the figure is the subject of intense contemplation. In the lower right corner, a painting of a woman is visible, presumably viewing the figure with eyes open. It is possible to read perhaps as a portrayal of the woman's piety, her humility, or her concern for her own troubled personal life.
