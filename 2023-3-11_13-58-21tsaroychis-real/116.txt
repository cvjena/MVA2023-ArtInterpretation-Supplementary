The painting is a seascape, possibly featuring Monet's customary shuttering of the shutters to demonstrate the transience of nature. The yellow sun sinking behind the horizon may be a reference to the onset of evening, while the churning waves suggest the Atlantic Ocean. The painting is composed of stripes, circles, and ovals, which suggest the movement of the ocean and the world around them. Monet's trademark use of light and color is evident in the scattering of light across the water and the way the waves seem to be moving in different directions.
