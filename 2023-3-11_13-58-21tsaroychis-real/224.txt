This painting could represent Blake's interpretation of Dante's Divine Comedy. It is possible that the landscape represents Hell, with its boiling lava and skeletal trees, while the figure of the poet represents Purgatory, with its streaming river of  snow. The halo around the poet's head may symbolize his divine mission. In the background, a belfry can be seen with its flickering flames, proclaiming the splendour of the afterlife. The eternal beauty of the poem is reflected in the timeless images.  There are many different interpretations that could be put on any painting, and the artist's intent is always murky. It is up to the viewer to decide what they believe to be the right interpretation.
