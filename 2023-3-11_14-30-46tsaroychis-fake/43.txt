This painting is of a Madonna and Child with St. John the Baptist. It is a very devotional work, and its main focus is on the religious figure. The colors are soft and pious, making it a pleasant and calming sight. The figures seem to be standing in a pastoral setting, and the woods behind them provide a natural backdrop. The viewer can sense the serenity and peace this painting portrays. Renoir was a master of capturing the essence of life, and this painting is a perfect example of that.  There are many possible interpretations for any artwork, and the best way to find out what might be right for you is to ask a museum or gallery staff.
