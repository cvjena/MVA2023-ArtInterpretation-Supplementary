Kirchner was un-ashamedly a self-taught artist and this painting reflects that. The painting is done in a " Studies " style, a method where an artist paints their subject from life but changes or blurs some details to capture the essence of the subject. Kirchner portrays himself with a cigarette in one hand and a mirror in the other, examining his own appearance. The background is a mixture of browns, including a dark streak that seems to represent the coal-fueled engine of the nearby railway. This industrial context might be reflective of Kirchner's years as a struggling artist, forced to sell his work for a pittance to survive.
