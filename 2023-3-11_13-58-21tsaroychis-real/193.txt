The portrait is largely composed of shades of brown, greys, and blacks, which provide a sense of intimacy and closeness between Nikolai and the artist. The main focus of the painting is Nikolai's face, which is shown in three-quarter view with a deep, furrowed brow and a confident look in his eyes. The artist has captured the essence of Nikolai's facial features, from the prominent bone structure in the forehead to the slightURNose shape above the lips. Vasily Perov has also used light and shadow to create a natural effect on Nikolai's face, giving him an appearancetwo-dimensional.
