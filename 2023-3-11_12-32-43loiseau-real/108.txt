This painting is patterned after the patterns on the back wall of the artist's home. It is a reminder of the barrier between life and art, and the constant reminder of change. The bright colors and the sharply contrasted tones create a sense of energy and dynamism. The painting is full of symbols that could be associated with the artist's life, such as the square in the foreground, which may be a representation of the studio where the artist spent much of his time. The flurry of activity in the background could be a representation of the turmoil he was experiencing at the time, as he was transitioning from being a outsider to being a leader. The busyness in the background could also be a representation of the turmoil he was experiencing as a musician.
