The painting is carefully composed and layered, with the mountain in the background adding a sense of depth, and the intricate brushstrokes making the sheep appear finely textured. The muted colors create a sense of warmth and tranquility. This is a pastoral scene that is peaceful and calming, and would be perfect for a room that is intended to promote relaxation and peace.  There are many possible interpretations of paintings, as the artist intended the painting to be interpreted in many different ways.
