The painting is a panorama of the northern coast of the Crimea - Ukraine. With its dramatically curving coastline and snow-capped mountains, the view is awe-inspiring. The deep blue water is studded with small white and grey boats, while rocky outcrops and a sandy shoreline outline the dramatic shoreline. On the horizon, the bewildering heights of the Caucasus can be seen. Aivazovsky was known for his breathtaking marine paintings, and this is one of his most dramatic examples. The painting could be interpreted as a representation of the majesty and awe of the natural world, or it could be seen as a commentary on the political and social turmoil of the time.
