This painting is likely a study of a human figure, with its features and clothing. The figure could be that of a woman, and the swirling lines in the background could possibly be depictions of either flowers or plants. The bright colors and intricate details in the painting could represent the artist's skill in depicting natural forms. Alternatively, the woman might be a model for the artist, and the painting could be a reflection of her beauty and skill. This artwork could be interpreted in a variety of ways, but one possible interpretation is that the woman is the artist himself, and she is looking at a woman in the street who is not his own reflection.
