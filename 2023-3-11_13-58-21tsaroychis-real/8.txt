This painting features a woman reclining on a bed in a semi-dark room, gazing off into the distance. The background is a deep, inky black, with only vague hints of lighter colors peeking out. The woman's dress appears to be floating in the darkness, as if she is hovering justabove the surface. A soft light streams in from the left, lending a touch of life to the otherwise somber scene. Rossetti often used dark, brooding colors to express his emotions, and this is one of his most popular works. It could be interpreted as a romantic portrayal of a woman lost in contemplation.
