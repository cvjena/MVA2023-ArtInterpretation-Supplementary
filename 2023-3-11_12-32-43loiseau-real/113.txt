The painting is of a group of women in a dark interior space. They are all looking at something in the distance. Some of the women are contemplating a book, while others are looking at pictures on a nearby table. The background is a dark, uneasy color, reminiscent of the night. The women's faces are serious and reflective, while the furnishings and the room itself are somber and understated. This may be a portrait of the artists herself, or it could be interpreted as a representation of the dark side of human nature. Some possible interpretations could be that the painting is a commentary on the difficulties of life, or that it symbolizes the fragility of life.
