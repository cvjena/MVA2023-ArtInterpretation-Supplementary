In the painting, a pastoral setting is presented with a river winding its way through the landscape. Hillsides are covered in forests and grazing cows can be seen in the distance. In the foreground a farmhouse can be seen with its leaking roof, while in the back, a view of the countryside extends to the horizon.   The predominant colors in the painting are blue and green, which create a calming and peaceful atmosphere. The painting is primarily composed of large, verdant fields and gentle blue skies, which creates a sense of infinite space. The muted colors give the impression of a dreamlike state, and the tranquility of the scene is likely what appealed to Camille Corot, who often depicted rural landscapes in his paintings.
