This still life features a grouping of objects on an octagonal mahogany table - a vase of flowers, a bowl of fruit, a book, and a crystal glass. The artist uses muted colors to create a very relaxing and pleasing composition. The soft, delicate colors give the painting a sweetness that is soothing and relaxing. The reflected elements in the water look like they are floating, adding an element of floating which is also reflected in the tranquil colors. The still life could be seen as a symbol of peace and tranquility, providing a moment of rest and relaxation. The artist also included a blue book in the top half of the table, which could represent the outside world.
