The tulips appear to be recoiling in the opposite direction, as if they are resisting the expansion of the circles.

The swirls and colors could symbolize the infinite potential that exists in the world. The painting could be interpreted as a meditation on the cycle of life, and the cycle of death. It could also be interpreted as a commentary on the cycle of life and the cycle of death.
