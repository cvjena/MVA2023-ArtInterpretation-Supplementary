This painting depicts the vast and rugged coastline of the Brittany Coast. The dark blues and greens of the ocean and the sandy beach contrast sharply with the bright white sand and the blue-green cliffs. Near the shore, a small fishing boat is belying its mast in the distance; onlookers can be seen on the other side of the beach. The painting seems to be almost alive with a sense of movement, as if the waves are crashing against the shore. The painting is impressionistic, with thick brushstrokes, and is full of bright colors. It could be interpreted as a representation of the seascape and its dangers that the viewer is likely to see in the future.
