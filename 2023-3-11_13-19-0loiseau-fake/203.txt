This abstract painting is made up of a series of geometric shapes, including squares, diamonds, circles, and other shapes that are overlaid on one another to create a unified image. The colors are typically cool and blues, greens, and purples, and the shapes are relatively simple, making this painting a good showcase for abstract art. Kirchner is famous for his abstract paintings, which typically explore the possibilities of composition and how different shapes and colors can be combined together to create a cohesive image. This painting is likely meant to be viewed early in the process of creating a work of art, as it is a very open-ended piece.
