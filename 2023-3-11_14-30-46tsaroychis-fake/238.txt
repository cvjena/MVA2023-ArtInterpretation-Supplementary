This painting is a religious scene, with the Virgin Mary and Child standing in a courtyard surrounded by several religious figures. The painting is high-key-colored, with a restrained realism in the faces. The Virgin is looking up towards the Child, who is holding a small model of the church, while the other figures kneel or pray. It could be seen as a depiction of the main beliefs of the time, that the Virgin Mary was a symbol of godly authority. The painting is said to have been commissioned by the Pope, and it is likely that it was intended to commemorate the Pope's visit to the monastery where the Virgin is said to have been buried.
