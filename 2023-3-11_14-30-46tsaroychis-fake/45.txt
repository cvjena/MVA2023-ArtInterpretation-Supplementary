The painting is mostly dark with a few bright highlights, and shows the Blessed Virgin Mary and Jesus in a standing position with both of their arms extended out toward one another. Their clothes are brightly lit, with highlights appearing on the robes, drapery, and even the drops of the Virgin's hair. Behind the figures is a cloudy sky, while behind the clouds is a faint, golden light.   The painting reflects the ongoing religious turmoil in Spain at the time, with the Catholic Church fighting against a Protestant uprising. The Catholic Church may represent order and stability, while Protestants are seen as threatening this balance.
