One possible interpretation of "Head of a Cowboy" is that the cowboy is a representation of Americana, embodying the United States' rugged frontier spirit. He is tall and strong, wearing a wide-brimmed hat and a long overcoat, showing the toughness and masculinity of the American West. The painting also has a solemn, emotional tone, as the cowboy's sad, downturned mouth implies a deep sadness. This painting could be seen as a portrait of a particular time and place, conveying the heroism and raw energy of the American West. Durer also features a nearby landscape, suggesting that the cowboy is probably the only person in the painting standing.
