This painting is abstract andshows the artist's mastery over the use of color and shape. The painting is mostly composed of shades of blue, with some areas that are more brightly colored. The shapes in the painting are not anatomically correct, but are more suggestive and abstract. The background is a light blue, and the shapes in the foreground are bigger and more rounded than those in the background. This gives the painting an almost three-dimensional quality.   This painting could depict the artist's admiration and respect for nature, or it could be interpreted as a commentary on the way society shapes and constrains the freedom of expression. It could also be interpreted as a celebration of life and happiness.
