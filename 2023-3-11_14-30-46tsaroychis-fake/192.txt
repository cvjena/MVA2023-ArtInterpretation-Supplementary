The Virgin Mary is shown seated in front of a painting on the wall, with two angels hovering nearby. The painting is composed of brightly-colored squares and rectangles, creating a motley effect. Below the painting, the Latin text reads: "Annuntiavit MariaeDominoIesuChristoPuerFiliusIeHomo." The painting is considered to be an early example of Renaissance painting, and it is believed that the angels in the background are representing the Church's dogma in its early stages. The central figure of the painting is thought to represent the Church's head of state, which is thought to be Christ.
