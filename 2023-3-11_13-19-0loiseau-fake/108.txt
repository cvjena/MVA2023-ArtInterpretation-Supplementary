In this painting, the Seine at Port Villes is flowing brightly and majestically by with rolling hills in the background. It's a peaceful scene, with a soft, golden sunlight shining down on the river. The banks are lined with trees and buildings, and the river is dotted with boats. The motif of water is central to this painting, and it has a majestic, visual impact. This painting is a wonderful example of Monet's skill as an artist, and it is a beautiful work of art.  Monet can be reached at matthew.brown at gmail.com.
