This painting is a study of light and shadow. The bright light coming in from the window casts a harsh shadow on the floor and the arbour gives a sense of shelter. The painting is muted in color, with Urizen standing in the shadow, just beyond the brightness. Urizen is looking off to the side, perhaps contemplating something. The wooden floor and an ornate crucifix add to the serenity of the scene. The painting could be interpreted as a tribute to the beauty of the narrow streets and the tranquility of the night. The muted colors could symbolize the artist's own feelings of peace and relaxation.
