This painting is a masterpiece of realism and realism captures movement. This painting is apparently of a moment in time, with instantaneous actions going on in the background. The placement of Christ, in the center of the cross, captures the viewer's eye and attention. In the lower right hand corner there is a man in robes carrying a book or scrolls. He may represent the jurists and scholars who were viewing and commenting on Christ's death. These people could be pointing to the inscription in Latin on the cross which captures the phrase "This is the true cross, which is the flesh and the blood of Jesus Christ." The cross is a representation of Jesus' death and resurrection. The people in the background could be looking on life passing by in the world.
