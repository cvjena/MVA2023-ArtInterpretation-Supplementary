The painting depicts a busy town square with buildings on each side. In the center is a large, centrally-placed fountain. The street in the background runs along the curve of the square and leads away to the right. There are several people walking around, and a horse and carriage can be seen parked nearby. This is a busy and thriving town, and it is a beautiful and serene setting. Schiele captures the vibrancy and energy of life in a lively but peaceful setting. He uses bright colors to make the town look lively and cheerful, and the streetlights give the impression of a glowing city. This is a beautiful painting that would be perfect for a room in the home.
