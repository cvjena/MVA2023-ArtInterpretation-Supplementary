This painting is of an elderly woman, Mie Louise Durand Ruel. Mie Louise was a French author, socialite, and art patron. She was also one of the first female members of the Impressionist Circle. The painting shows her with a fur Coat, sitting in a chair, close to a window. The light coming in casts a shadow over her face and creates a ethereal quality to the painting. She is looking outward, seeminglylost in thought. The deep blue color gives the impression of depth and insight, while the golden light coming in through the window gives the impression of warmth and happiness.
