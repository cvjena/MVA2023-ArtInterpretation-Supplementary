The painting depicts a scene from the history of Eastern Roman Empire, in which the last Roman Emperor Diocletian abdicated his throne in order to preserve the government and the imperial form for future generations. At the time of painting, it was the end of the 18th century and the empire was in decline; this is reflected in the ruined state of the buildings in the scene and the people depicted, who appear tired and depleted. It's possible that the artist was inspired by illustrations from ancient Greek and Roman history texts, which he might have encountered during his education. Alternatively, the scene could be seen as a metaphor for the decline of an old, powerful order, or even symbolized the end of an era.
