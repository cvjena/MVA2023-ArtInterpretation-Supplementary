The forest is a dense and dark place, where the trees and underbrush can easily conceal someone or something. The painting has a feeling of mystery, as if the viewer is being led into the forest by an unseen hand. There are deep shadows created by the trees, and the brushstrokes seem to be floating above the surface of the painting, giving the impression that the painting is three-dimensional. In the background, you can see the banks of the River Seine, which adds to the anticipation of exploration. This could be interpreted as a metaphor for the passage of time, with the forest representing the growth of life.
