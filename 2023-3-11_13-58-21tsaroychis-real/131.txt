This painting is of a stunning waterfall that's cascading down a cliff. The water is a deep blue, and the landscape is outlined in a white outline. At the bottom of the waterfall, there's a small path that winds its way around the waterfall, and in the background, you can see a hill and a forest. This painting could represent the beauty of nature, and the fear of being lost in the natural world. Alternatively, it could be seen as a symbol of the flow of life, and the inevitability of change. Konchalovsky was known for his peaceful and serene paintings of nature, and this waterfall is a perfect example of that.
