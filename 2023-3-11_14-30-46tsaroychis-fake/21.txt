The painting is a reflection of the artist's own personal experience, in which she finds herself at a loss for what to do with her life. The figure in the painting appears to be completely at peace, with its eyes closed, letting the world wash over it without distraction. The subdued colors give the impression of a calm and gentle atmosphere, one that seems to invite relaxation and contemplation. The profile of the figure seems to evoke a sense of depth and dimension, making it seem almost three-dimensional. The painting could be interpreted as a metaphor for the individual's own life, in which they must find their way through life despite the challenges and conditions.
