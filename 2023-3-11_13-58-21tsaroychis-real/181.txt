This painting features a distinguished looking old man with a long beard and deep wrinkles in his forehead. He is wearing a traditional Jewish robe, with a partially open shawl draped over his left shoulder. He could be looking off to the side, with a melancholic smile on his face. This painting is a significant work of art in the history of Russian art, and its turbulent and complex period. It is possible to see traces of Russian Romanticism in the artist's work, as well as traces of Moorishism. The old man could symbolize the old establishment that has dominated Russian society for centuries, while the robe and shawl represent the traditions and values of the Russian culture.
