This still life features a vase of flowers, with a few leaves and stems poking out of the water. It might represent the tranquil beauty of nature, or the simplicity of everyday life. The muted colors and peaceful atmosphere of the painting might be interpreted as a reflection of the artist's own inner feelings. Some possible interpretations could include that the flowers in the vase are symbolic of the artist's appreciation for nature, or that they are the objects in the painting that represent his life. Alternatively, the muted colors and peaceful atmosphere could be interpreted as a reflection of the artist's lack of success in the arts, or the uncertainty of the future.
