This painting is a portrait of Charles IV, the last Habsburg King of Spain. It is a very tense, confrontational portrait, with Goya clearly capturing the King's displeasure and anger. He seems to be looking directly at the viewer, with a fierce gaze, and his hair is ruffled, as if he is violently shaking. His clothes are highly formal, and he is wearing a finely embroidered coat and yellow waistcoat, which gives an extreme contrast to his pale skin. Many people see in this portrait the influence of Napoleon, who conquered Spain in 1786.
