This abstract painting features a female figure with long, flowing hair cascading down her back. She appears to be wearing a white dress over a dark blue background, and her face is shrouded in a white veil. This painting could represent the duality of life - the beauty and power of nature, and the fragility of life. The woman's facial features are delicate and ethereal, yet they are also powerfully peaceful and calming. This painting could be seen as a tribute to the power of the female form, and to the universality of beauty.  A possible interpretation of "Untitled 1925" could be that it is a painting about the beauty of life, and about the duality of life.
