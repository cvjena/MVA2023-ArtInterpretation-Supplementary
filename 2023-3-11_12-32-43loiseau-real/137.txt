This painting is a religious scene where the Virgin Mary is comforting a repentant Magdalene with her hand on her shoulder. The Magdalene is in a state of humility, attentive and receptive to Mary's words of comfort. She is shown wearing a long white dress with a blue mantle, representing her connection to heaven. She has long, curly hair and a downcast look, representing her state of misery and repentance. El Greco's use of bright colors and intense emotions reflects the religious fervor of the time. This painting is a perfect example of the Baroque style.
