This large painting depicts a brutal storm at sea. Waves are raging, the skies are dark and ominous, and there is an intense orange glow in the distance. The dramatic gesture and powerful colors create an effect that is both powerful and introspective. The painting could be interpreted as a symbol of the artist's fear and fury at the world. Alternatively, it could be seen as a depiction of tranquility and peace. The painting is perfect for a seaside cottage, as it is peaceful and relaxing. The orange glow could represent warmth and security, while the darkness could represent the excitement and fear of the storm. The painting would likely evoke feelings of jealousy and insecurity.
