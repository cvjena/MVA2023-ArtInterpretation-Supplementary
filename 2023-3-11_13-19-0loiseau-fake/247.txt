This painting is a portrait of a young woman. Her outfit is reminiscent of the time period in which it was painted, which could make it 1870s-1880s. She has a regal air about her, and she appears to be looking down at the viewer with a sense of expectancy. Her skin is a delicate shade of ivory, and her hair is styled in a bun. She might be posing for a formal portrait, or she might be interacting with someone close to her. Her garments could reveal something about her personality or character, and her pose could suggest what she is feeling. The background behind her is completely blank, suggesting that she is the only focus in the painting.
