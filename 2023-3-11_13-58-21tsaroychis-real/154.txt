This painting depicts a pastoral landscape with a river running between two hills. The setting is strikingly reminiscent of the depictions of Eden in classical art. In the sky, a bank of pink clouds reflects the sun's light, lending a warm hue to the landscape. The foreground is sparse, with just a few trees and bushes, while the background stretches off into the horizon. In the foreground, a man can be seen walking along the river, and a boat can be seen approaching from the opposite bank. Rossetti's use of light and shadow is expert, and he has crafted an arresting image that is sure to captivate viewers.
