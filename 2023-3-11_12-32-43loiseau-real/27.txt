The colors are soft and muted, which gives the painting a calm feeling. The artist has used long, thin brushstrokes to create a delicate image. This painting could be interpreted as a depiction of a typical life in a tranquil setting. The flowers provide a symbol of purity and innocence, which is emphasized by the soft colors. The wine bottle and fruit bowl are a reminder of the food that the child will experience in childhood, and the setting is tranquil and peaceful.
