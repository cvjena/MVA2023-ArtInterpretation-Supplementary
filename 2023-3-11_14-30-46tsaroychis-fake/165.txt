In this painting, the artist uses a light and airy palette to capture the beauty of wheatfields in the snow. The colors are delicate and soothing, perfect for a cold winter day. The fields are tiny and peaceful, surrounded by a layer of snow on top. The surrounding trees are barren and stark, dwarfed by the snow. This peaceful and serene painting could be used in a setting that is cold and bleak, reminder that nature is still full of beauty and potential for growth.  A possible interpretation of this painting could be that the wheat fields are a representation of the fragile state of the world in which the artist lived. The snow field is a representation of the snow that covers the land.
