The sculpture is thought to depict Rodin's first wife Germaine. The figure is clothed in a flowing gown that reflects the light in a way that creates the illusion of movement. The face is serene and has a hint of sadness, which may be a reference to Rodin's break-up with Germaine. Some people believe that the bust may also be a reference to Rodin's own mortality, as the face seems to be mutable and could be seen as reflecting changes over time. Others see Rodin's mental journey as a metaphor for Rodin's relationship with Germaine. It is possible that the bust is a stand-in for Rodin's separation from Rodin himself.
