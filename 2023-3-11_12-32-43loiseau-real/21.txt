The flowers in this painting are arranged in a vase, with a marble top. The colors are muted, almost faded, giving the impression that the flowers have been around for a long time and are losing their energy. The petals are lain flat on the surface of the vase, giving the impression of fragility. The quiet colors may or may not be a coincidence - they may be hinting at the precariousness of life. The marble surface may be a symbol of the decay of society, or of the difficulties of life in general. Kirchner often used natural elements as props for the foreground, adding a touch of realism to the scene.
