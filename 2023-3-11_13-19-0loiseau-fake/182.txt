This painting is about a storm that has broken over the ocean. The dark clouds looming overhead, the raging waves in the foreground, and therenched sun all add to the feeling of danger and intensity. The orange and pink hues in the sky give the impression of a fierce gust of wind, and the painting as a whole feels alive with the drama of the ocean. The triangle shapes in the center of the painting indicate a lighthouse light, lending urgency to the situation. This could be a symbol of hope, brightness, and protection. The painting could also be interpreted as a metaphor for the French Revolution, with the bright colors representing the turmoil and violence of the time.
