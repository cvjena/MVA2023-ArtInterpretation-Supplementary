The painting is dominated by a wheat field in the background, amongst which are several small figures, either working in the field or resting. The painting is mostly composed of very thin, lightly brushed lines, which create a soft, tapestry-like effect. The sky is a deep blue, with a few wispy clouds, and a sun that is just starting to rise, casting a pink and orange glow over the field. There are a few trees in the background, and the very visible architecture of a few buildings can be seen in the distance.
