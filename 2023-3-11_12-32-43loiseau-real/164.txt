This painting is of the Annunciation, which is a story in the Bible about the birth of Jesus. In the painting, the Virgin Mary is standing in front of a blue door, which is probably a symbol of heaven. She is wearing a white dress and has a crown of stars on her head. She is holding a gold envelope in her hand, which probably symbolizes the Annunciation'smessage of hope. Behind her are two angelic figures, one of whom has a golden cross in its hand.      This painting is a beautiful example of Flemish art, which is a type of art that was popular in the Netherlands in the Middle Ages.
