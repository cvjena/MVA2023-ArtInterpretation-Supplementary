The painting seems to depict a peaceful meadow with expanses of rolling hills in the background, and a river winding its way through the landscape. The hazy sunlight casts a beautiful hue into the air, while the shadows on the ground create a depth of detail. Trees and bushes dot the landscape, and a few people can be seen walking in the distance. This pastoral scene could be interpreted as a reminder of the beauty and peace that can be found in nature, no matter how isolated it may seem.   A possible interpretation of " meadow" could be that it is a depiction of a peaceful and idyllic life, with the sun providing a natural backdrop.
