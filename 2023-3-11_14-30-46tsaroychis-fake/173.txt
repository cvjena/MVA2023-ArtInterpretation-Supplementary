This painting is a triptych, with each side depicting a different setting. On the left is a lamp lit inside an empty room, on the right is a light casting a glowing path on the floor, and in the center is a lightbulb screwed into the wall. The middle section is mostly white, except for a spot where the light shines on a black object. Shadows are created by the objects on the other sides of the light. This painting could represent different day-to-day moments in someone's life, such as when they are working in a brightly lit area and then going to a more private area to read or to sleep.
