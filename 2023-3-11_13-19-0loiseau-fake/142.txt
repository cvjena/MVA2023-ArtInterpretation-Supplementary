This painting is a dreamscape of an exotic and mysterious place. On a clear day, the sky is a deep blue and the buildings and landscape look like they're floating on a cloud. But in the nighttime view, the buildings are tucked behind a looming, black cloud, and the sky has turned a deep, gloomy gray. In the foreground, a woman stares out at the view, appearing lost in contemplation. She might be contemplating the strange, mystical sights before her, or she might be feeling lost and alone. Rossetti used a delicate and evocative brushstroke to create a sense of depth and space in this painting. This painting could be interpreted as a depiction of the artist's feelings of isolation and loneliness.
