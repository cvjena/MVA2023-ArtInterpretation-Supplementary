The tree is Barefoot and the brushstrokes are Thick, adding an extra strength to the painting. The tree is in the midst of a large depression, with the trees on either side of it. The banks of the river are in the distance, and the water is dark and murky. The viewer is looking at the tree while the brushstrokes arestroking across the canvas. This painting is considered to be one of Rembrandt's most iconic pieces, and is often compared to his other works such as "Starry Night" and "Abstract Painting".  One possible interpretation of this painting is that it is a reflection of the artist's feelings at the time he created it.
