In this portrait, the sitter is seen from the front. She is posed with her head bent down, looking away from the camera, and her hands crossed in front of her. She might be thought of as introspective or even heart-broken, with her sad expression and delicate features. The composition is wide and expansive, featuring a deep background and foreground, and suggests a brooding atmosphere. The way that Kustodiev has captured the sitter's shaded skin and finely drawn features gives the painting a feeling of depth and richness. In particular, the deep shadows on the sitter'sresses' hair and dress add to the sense of mystery and melancholia.
