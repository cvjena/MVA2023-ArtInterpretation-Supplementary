The painting is a still life of a small wooden pier, with a promontory and into the distance. The painting is dominated by the green and brown of the water and the sky, with the reflections of the buildings in the water. The painting has a calm and the artist has used light and shadow to create a realistic effect. The pier is a popular destination of the artist, and the promontory is a popular area of the city. It is possible to see a number of boats in the harbour, and in the distance you can see the outline of a mountain.   The painting could represent the beauty of the city and the vibrancy of life, with the pier a welcomed shelter from the outside world.
