The painting is a sparse, desolate landscape, with a lone figure walking through the center. The sky is a deep, inky blue, and the ground is covered in a heavy, black sand. The central figure is a heav-oft white man, his hands clasped in front of him as if in prayer. It's possible that the figure is Christ, or Messiah, where the painting falls. The overall feeling is one of dread and loneliness, as if the viewer is witnessing a death that is sure to come.  A possible interpretation of the painting could be that it is a depiction of the aftermath of a death, with the figure being dominated by the deathly pallor of the surface.
