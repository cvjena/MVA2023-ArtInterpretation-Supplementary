The painting is of Maffeo Barberini, who served as the tenth Prince of Paliano and as the Archbishop of Rome from 1597 to 1607. He was a powerful and influential man, and Caravaggio painted his portrait as a demonstration of his skill. The artist has used natural light and shadow to create a realistic portrait, and the Cardinal's imposing appearance is conveyed well. Caravaggio was known for his violent paintings, but this one is peaceful and serene. The background is a mix of greens and blues, giving the painting a sense of depth. The elegance of the portrait is a perfect metaphor for the power and authority of the Archbishop.
