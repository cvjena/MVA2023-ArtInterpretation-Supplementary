In this painting, we see St. James being arrested. He is wearing a long robe and appears to be resigned to his fate. His face is serene, as if he is resigned to the will of God. Behind him, we can see the ruins of a building. This painting could be interpreted as a religious image, or it could be interpreted as a depiction of medieval life.
