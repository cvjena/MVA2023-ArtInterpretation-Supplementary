The painting is composed of deep blue and violet octagonal shapes, with a focus on the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic Ocean is a vast, open ocean, and is perhaps the most peaceful place in the world. The colors are calming, and go well together with the white clouds and blue waves in the background. The painting could represent the artist's love for the United States and all of its wonderful ways. It's a beautiful piece that captures a moment in time.  There are a lot of interpretations that could be put on this painting, as it is incredibly versatile. It could be interpreted as a snapshot of the United States during the mid-19th century, or it could be interpreted as a depiction of the artist's homeland at that time.
