This painting features a young woman in a garden, likely in the evening. She is posed against a bright blue background, and appears to be looking straight ahead. Her hair is loose and she is wearing a light blue dress. She appears relaxed and content, and may represent the idyllic nature of life in the French countryside. The painting could be interpreted as a snapshot of a happy moment in the woman's life, or as a depiction of the elegance and beauty of nature. It could also be interpreted as a comment on the superiority of women in the medieval classes. Pissarro often used light and shade to create a subtle atmosphere of tension and emotion in his paintings.
