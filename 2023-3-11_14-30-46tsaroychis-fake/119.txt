The landscape is bathed in a pinkish glow, created by the setting sun and the water. The river curves beneath a bridge, leading to the horizon. On the left, the countryside is dotted with farms, while on the right stands a small city. The buildings are silhouetted against the sky, and the smoke from their chimneys drifts lazily up. Nearby, a herd of cows is grazing.  This painting is a depiction of the idyllic countryside life typical of the Middle Ages. The peaceful, peacefulness of the scene is conveyed through the serene beauty of the landscape, the soft light, and the tranquil atmosphere of the city.
