This painting is composed of a deep blue background against which are laid a series of white shapes which could be waves, or possibly seagulls. The composition is very simple, with just a few lines outlining the shapes, and the thick, saturated color gives the impression of depth. The bright white of the surf against the deep blue sky gives the painting a sense of energy and movement, while the delicate lines of the gulls add a touch of realism. The high contrast between the light and dark colors makes this a very lively painting. The mural could be interpreted as a representation of the cityscape below the water, with the bright colors representing the sun and the waves representing the sea.
