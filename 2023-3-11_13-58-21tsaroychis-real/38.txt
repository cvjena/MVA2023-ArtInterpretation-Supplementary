The portrait is of a distinguished-looking man with a stern expression. He might represent the warrior class or, more specifically, the condottieri - professional mercenary soldiers - who were a common sight in Italy during Antonello's time. He might be wearing armour and a cloak, signifying his martial role, and his straight, combed hair might suggest status and power. The sitter's features have been crafted to project power and majesty: the long, narrow nose with a well-defined bridge, the chin firm and proud, the eyeBROWS slightly arched.     There is much we still don't know about this painting, and interpretations will doubtless continue to change over time.
