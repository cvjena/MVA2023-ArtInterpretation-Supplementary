This landscape is reminiscent of the open landscapes seen in Dutch paintings of the 17th century. The background is a patchwork of browns, yellows and blues, while the foreground is dominated by a large tree in the center, with acres of grass and plants all around it. The painting is a snapshot of nature in its natural state, unaltered by man. The tree may represent a symbol of stability and life, while the surrounding landscape may represent the hope for a new beginning.  This painting could be interpreted as a statement about the power of the painter, as well as about the vastness of the universe.
