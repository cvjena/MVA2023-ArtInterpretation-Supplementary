This painting is of a nude woman reclining on a bed. She is covered with a sheer coverlet, and her long, dark hair cascades down over her naked shoulders. She has her eyes closed and her mouth is slightly open, as if she is about to drift off to sleep. Theatrically, the composition is balanced on the left side by a low columns, giving the impression that the woman is resting peacefully in the lap of luxury. Yet the atmosphere is slightly charged, as if something is lurking just out of view, threatening to disrupt the calm. The woman's delicate features are highlighted by her delicate nose and eyebrows, and her long, dark hair seems to be draped over her shoulders.
