This painting is interpreted to depict two women in a pastoral setting. One woman is holding a basket of flowers, while the other woman has her hand on the other woman's shoulder. They are both looking in the same direction, possibly representing the hope and potential for the land. The background is a field with trees in the distance. This could suggest that the women are looking out at the beauty of the land, which is a source of strength and security to the woman. The colors in the painting are peaceful and calming, which could suggest that the women are safe and secure.   Alternatively, the painting could be interpreted as a symbol of the cycle of life and death.
