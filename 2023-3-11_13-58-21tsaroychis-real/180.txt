The turkey keeper is depicted as an old man with long, grizzled hair. He's dressed in a suit, and he's holding a turkey in his hands. This painting is a very realistic representation of a real person, and it's easy to imagine that the turkey was actually in this man's hands. One possible interpretation of this painting is that it's a portrait of the man's father, who was a farmer. The painting might also be a reflection of the man's own life, and the turkey may be a symbol of the man's own farming skills. Other possible interpretations could be that the man is a reflection of the average person, and that the turkey is a symbol of the man's own life, and the farming skills.
