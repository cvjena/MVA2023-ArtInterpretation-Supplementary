This portrait is thought to depict Antonello as a contemplative figure, with his head bowed and his eyes closed. The deep shadows on his face and the convexity of his features give the impression of intensity and deep thought. The fine details in his suit and the inscription on the vase behind him add to the realism of the painting. It is possible that Antonello may have seen this painting as a symbol of his own creative power and aspirations. This painting could also suggest the theme of concentration and abstraction. The artist often portrayed himself as an artist, and this painting may be seen as a reflection of that.
