This painting was created in 1941, during World War Two, when Prendergast was living in Assisi, Italy. The painting is a depiction of the Basilica of San Francesco. Prendergast uses a strong yellow and blue color palette to create a sense of energy and life, while also conveying a sense of calm and peace. The Basilica is a beautiful structure, and Prendergast skillfully captures the architecture and the landscape in the background of the painting. The painting is significant because it captures the spirit of Assisi during a time of turmoil, and it is a beautiful representation of the city.
