This still life is composed of a vase of golden chrysanthemums resting atop a dark wood table. Various leaves and stems, twigs, and flowers are bundled together in a chaotic, but naturalistic way. The bright colors and busy composition add life and vibrancy to the painting, while the dark wood and detailed textures give it a deep, mysterious feel. This painting might represent the artist's feelings of chaotic emotions, but also his feelings of peace and stability. The dark wood table represents the stability and stability of nature, which is why it could be symbolizing the artist's feelings of stability and stability in the face of chaos. The dark wood table could also be symbolizing the artist's feelings of turmoil and isolation.
