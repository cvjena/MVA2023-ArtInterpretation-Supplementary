This painting is about a woman who is in love with a man who does not love her back. The woman is shown holding a heart-shaped pendant as well as a book. The man is not paying attention to her and is looking away. This could be interpreted as the woman trying to get the man's attention, or it could be interpreted as the man not wanting to be with the woman. The dark, moody colors could represent the sadness and emotions the woman is feeling. The bright, colorful highlights could be interacting with the darkness in the background. This could be a contrast to the dark, rich colors of the man. The painting could also be interpreted as a symbol of the woman's wealth and power.
