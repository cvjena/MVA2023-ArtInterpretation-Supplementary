This painting depicts the biblical story of King Solomon's judgment of the ten tribes of Israel. At the center of the painting is a large, elaborate throne, and on either side of the throne are rows of cherubim. Above the throne is a glowing, purple sky, and in the background is a view of the Jerusalem Temple. The faces of the people appearing in the painting are twisted in emotions ranging from joy to anger. This painting is a complex and majestic representation of religious and judicial allegory. It could be interpreted as a symbol of the power and wealth of the king, who is seated on the throne of God.
