This painting is a depiction of a church in the village of Ville D Avray. The church is situated in the center of the town and the large windows let in a flood of light. The architecture of the church is typical of the period and it is painted in a style reminiscent of Impressionism. The painting is sitting on a hill that leads down to the church and so could be interpreted in a number of ways. It could be interpreted as a peaceful oasis in a chaotic world, or as a reminder of the church's importance in the community. It could also be interpreted as a symbol of the church's dedication to nature, or as a symbol of the natural beauty of the town.
