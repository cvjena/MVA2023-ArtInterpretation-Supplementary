In this painting, the sun is setting and the tide is coming in. The background is filled with waves crashing onto the beach. All of the colors in the painting are muted, with the exception of a light blue in the sky. The tide is coming in so quickly that it is almost spilling over the edge of the canvas. The painting seems to depict both the rushing chaos of life and the beauty of nature. The light blue in the background represents the sky, while the darkness represents the ocean. The painting seems to depict both the chaotic and natural aspects of life. It could be interpreted as a representation of the slower, more natural aspects of life. The painting is also representative of the growth of the city.
