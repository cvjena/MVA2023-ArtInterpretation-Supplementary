This painting is a depiction of St. Catherine of Siena married to Christ, considered one of the most popular religious paintings of the Renaissance. Catherine is seen wearing a rich, brocaded dress and veil, with a band around her head representing the religious orders she had founded. She leans against Christ's chest with her hands folded in prayer, and looking up at him with ardent devotion. Behind her, you can see the Siena Cathedral and its surrounding piazza, and in the background you can see a blue sky, possibly representing the Virgin Mary's sky.  The meaning of this painting is a little bit difficult to determine, as it could be interpreted in a number of ways.
