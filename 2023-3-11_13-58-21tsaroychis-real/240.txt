This painting features a lone figure walking on the pier, looking out at the waters. The brightly-colored sand and marine life paints a beautiful picture, contrasting with the whiteness of the pier and the clouds in the sky. The perfect backdrop for a summer day. The sweeping lines and cleanliness of the waves give the painting a feeling of vitality, while the warm colors create a feeling of peace and serenity. This is a timeless painting that will last for many years to come. The blues in the sky, the sea, and the people orange might suggest that the summer season is a time of relaxation and peace. The orange color could also symbolize the warmth and comfort of life.
