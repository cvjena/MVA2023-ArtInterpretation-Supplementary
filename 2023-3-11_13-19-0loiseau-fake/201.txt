The painting is composed of delicate, overlapping petals around a central stem. The blue of the flowers is offset by the green of the leaves and the brown of the stem. The flowers are remarkably luminous, as if they have a inner light. The intensity of blue in the flowers underscores the overall somber mood of the painting, which may be a depiction of the narratorâ€™s grief over the death of a loved one. The muted colors may also reflect the tranquility of the scene. In the background, a treelike shadow stretches out across the bottom of the flower. This shadow may represent the silhouette of the deceased. Alternatively, the treelike shadow could represent the afterlife.
