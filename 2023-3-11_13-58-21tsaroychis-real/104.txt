This painting is of a lighthouse, at Honfleur, in Normandy, France. The lighthouse is looking out to the sea, and the sky behind it is clear and bright, with a few clouds. The lighthouse is a tall, white tower, with a red light at the top. The light is shining brightly, and it gives a sense of security and protection to people who are sailing in the ocean. The painting has a very peaceful feeling to it, and it might be used to show how important the lighthouse is to society. The bright colors might also be used to show the brightness of the ocean, which is a good place for a lighthouse.
