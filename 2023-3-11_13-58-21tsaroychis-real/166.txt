The portrait is of a distinguished-looking, middle-aged man with a stern expression. De La Tour is known for his naturalistic and dramatic paintings, and this one is no exception. The man's skin is tightly drawn across his cheekbones, and his deep-set eyes appear to be penetrating the viewer. His suit and the stark white linen shirt seem to be finely detailed and accurate representations of the era. The background is filled with swirls and curves that could represent the turmoil and upheaval of the era. The man seems to be towering over the viewer, conveying a sense of power and authority. This painting could be interpreted as a portrait of a distinguished-looking man, or one of the artist's own self-portraits.
