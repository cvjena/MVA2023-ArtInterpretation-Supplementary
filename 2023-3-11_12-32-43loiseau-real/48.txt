This self portrait is a complex and iconic piece. It shows Rembrandt as a dignified and powerful man, with a sharp, aquiline nose and penetrating gaze. His thick, wavy hair is carefully styled and hangs over his forehead in a thick mass, partially obscuring his eyes. He is wearing a finely tailored shirt and cloak, and his hands are folded in contemplation. This is a powerful and iconic painting, which has been interpreted in many ways. One interpretation could be that this is a depiction of Rembrandt's own vanity and self-confidence, as well as his ability to portray his subjects perfectly. Another interpretation could be that this painting is a representation of his own power and influence, as well as his vulnerability.
