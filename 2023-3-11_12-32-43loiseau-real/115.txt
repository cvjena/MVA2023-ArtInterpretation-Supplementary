This painting is a view of a room in which a group of people are gathered, with Natalia Pavlovna seated in the center. She is flanked on either side by two gentlemen - one older, one younger - and behind her, in the distance, can be seen a well-lit window. The painting is heavily decorated with elaborate, colorful fabrics, and the somber tones of the black and white paint lend the scene a feeling of tranquility. Konstantin Somov's painting is a beautiful depiction of aristocrats and their social lives, and it is likely that he was inspired by Russian history and culture when he created it. Konstantin Somov is known for his detailed and realistic paintings, and this painting is no exception.
