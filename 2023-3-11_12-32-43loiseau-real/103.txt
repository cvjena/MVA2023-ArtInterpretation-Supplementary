The subject is sitting with one arm on the table and the other resting on the armrest, looking at someone behind the person to the right. The light is streaking in from the window and the man is silhouetted against it. This could be a portrait of someone close to the artist, or it could be a portrait of a dead person. The man's face is somber and his eyes seem to be filled with sadness. The background is largely black, suggesting that the painting is in darkness. The window might be open to the outside world, or it might be open to the outside world and the man is not sure what is happening. The painting could be about the man's life or its subject.
