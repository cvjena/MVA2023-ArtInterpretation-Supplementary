This painting portrays an event from the Bible in which the Virgin Mary visits St. Elizabeth in Samaria while her son, Jesus, is in the temple in Jerusalem. Elizabeth is presiding over a meeting of the dignitaries of the Kingdom of Judah when the Virgin Mary, accompanied by St. John the Baptist and some other religious figures, enters the room. Elizabeth greets the visitors and then falls down at Virgin Mary's feet to worship her. The other visitors are either awestruck or offended by Elizabeth's display of piety. The Virgin Mary then addresses the assembled dignitaries, praising them for their devotion to God. The painting demonstrates the complex relationships between the different religious groups in medieval Europe.
