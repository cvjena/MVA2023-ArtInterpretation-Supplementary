In this painting, Jesus is depicted as a tortured, bleeding figure. The Crucifixion is a particularly harrowing event in history, and Perugino renders it sympathetically, showing Jesus as an earthly being who is suffused with suffering. In the foreground, hisfigure is highlighted by a golden light, which suggests the presence of heavenly beings who are witnessing the crucifixion. The other figures in the painting are shadowy, suggesting that they are cast into deep shadow by the tragedy unfolding before them. The bleak atmosphere is emphasised by the deep blue tones of the sky and the dreary colours of the robes of the Virgin and the figures.
