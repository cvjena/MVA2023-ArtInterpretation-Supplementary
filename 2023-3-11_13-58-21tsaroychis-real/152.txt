The painting is set on a rugged and mountainous coastline on the coast of Crete. The deep blue of the sea and the bright yellow and green of the sun set against the deep blue sky create an dramatic and seemingly contradictionary image. The viewer is surrounded by a turbulent and grandiose landscape, while the calm and shallow waters at their feet reflect the peacefulness and serenity of the setting. The perspective of the painting is from high up, which gives the impression of looking down at the scene from a great height. The painting could be interpreted as a representation of the power and majesty of the European Empire, while the peaceful and imposing scenery could be seen as a symbol of the stability and strength of the Crete people.
