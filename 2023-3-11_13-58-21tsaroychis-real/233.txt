The painting is dominated by a giant, demonic-looking figure surrounded by swirling, demonic-looking clouds and flames. Around the figure are a series of smaller demons, all depicted in the grotesque and detestable manner characteristic of Bosch. Within the twisted and distorted body of the giant figure, one can see human bones and bloody entrails. This could be seen as a symbol of temptation, of the devil's attempt to lure Saint Anthony into sin. The painting is strikingly violent, and its stark beauty would dominate any Bosch painting for centuries to come. This painting is a powerful statement about the power of evil and the way that it can be used to harm and destroy innocent people.
