The sitter, Yekaterina Kustodieva, is depicted against a dark, moody background. She has a serene, contemplative look, and is clutching a white flower. The painting may depict Kustodiev's feelings for Yekaterina, or may simply be a beautiful portrait. In any case, the painting is an excellent example of 19th century Realism. Kustodiev was known for his many atmospheric portraits, and this one is no exception. With its atmospheric, muted colors, this painting may convey the atmosphere of deep sadness that is often associated with moments of tragedy. This still life may be a representation of a time of personal pain and turmoil.
