This painting is set in a cold and bleak landscape, with a snowy sky and barren trees. It may represent the artist's feelings of loneliness and longing, as he was living in the city at the time. The only other object in the painting is a small sparrow, which may symbolize the isolation and loneliness the artist felt. The reds in the landscape may represent the heat of the day, while the bluesiness could represent the coldness of the life. The other objects in the painting may represent other people in the scene, which might symbolize the loneliness of the artist himself.
