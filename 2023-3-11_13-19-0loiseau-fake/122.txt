The painting features a tranquil countryside setting with a large white poplar tree in the foreground. The sky is a deep blue, and there are a few clouds in the sky. The painting is mostly green and there is a brightly shining sun in the background. There is a small town with a few houses and a church in the distance. This could be a representation of the artist's home town, or it could be a representation of the happiness and peace that he found in nature. The bright and shining sun could be a representation of the artist's hope for the future. The painting could also be interpreted as a metaphor for the eternal beauty of life.
