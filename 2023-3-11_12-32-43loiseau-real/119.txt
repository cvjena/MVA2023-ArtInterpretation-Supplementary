This painting portrays a group of people who are addicted to and surrounded by materialism. The excessive accumulation of objects in the background suggests their lack of enjoyment in life and their lack of self-awareness. The people are wearing old, tattered clothing and have faces covered in soot, indicating their low social status. Only a small minority of objects is actually of any value, while the majority of items are either broken or of little value. This composition suggests that a person who is not gulled by their own appearance, but by the soot and derelict clothing of the majority of their peers, is doomed to stay in bed and do nothing for the rest of their lives.
