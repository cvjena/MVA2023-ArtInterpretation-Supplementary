Many theories have been put forward as to what the painting is actually depicting. A popular interpretation is that it is a self-portrait, with Leonardo himself as the subject. In this painting, Leonardo has explored a range of proportions not seen in traditional human sculptures. The head is elongated, the neck long and the body slim, with the hands and feet unusually small. These proportions may have been intended to reflect the ideal proportions of the human body as understood by Leonardo. The red, orange and yellow hues in the painting are all complementary and create aivating presence. The viewer can sense the intensity of the moment as the figure is every bit as alive as the objects in the foreground.
