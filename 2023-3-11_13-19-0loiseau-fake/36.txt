This painting depicts a dense forest leading to a cliff edge. If you look closely, you can see the silhouettes of trees in the distance. The green forest is wonderfully evocative, and the bright blue sky is stunning. This could be interpreting the forest as a place of safety, comfort, and refuge, as well as a place of danger. The trees in the foreground could be representing the natural wisdom that is still present even in the forest, and the cliff edge could represent the likely future location of the painting. The painting could be interpreted as a reminder of the beauty and peace of the natural world, and of the spiritual journey of the individual.
