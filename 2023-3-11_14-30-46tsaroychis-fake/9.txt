The painting is a vibrantly colorful composition, with intense oranges, yellows, and reds. The movement depicted may represent the sound of the ocean waves, or the vibrations of the air themselves. The name "Tremolo" may also reference the way the colors seem to be flickering and wavering. The cavities in the foreground that make up the center of the painting may be a representation of the entrance to the underworld. The dark colors give the impression of depth and suggest the power and mystery of the ocean. The peaceful setting could be a metaphor for the tranquility that the artist found in the world around him. The painting could also be interpreted as a representation of the artist's own inner peace.
