The painting is set in a wheat field and has the feel of a journey. There are many people in the field, some are eating, others are walking. The sky is blue and cloudy, there is a light breeze, and/or a gust of wind. There are several mountains in the background, including a large, imposing mountain range. The painting is largely composed of colorful fields, with few details. This suggests that the painting is a portrayal of a moment in time, or even a scene in history. It could be interpreted as a commentary on social interaction and the way that we are all connected in the world. The mountains in the background could represent the power of the mountains, which are constantly moving and changing.
