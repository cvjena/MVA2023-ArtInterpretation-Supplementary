The portrait is of a man in his early 30s, with a sorrowful expression. He could be a general or a nobleman, the lines around his eyes and mouth are subtle and deep. He is wearing a brocade jacket and his hair is combed back, giving him a dignified look. He looks exhausted, as if he's been through a lot. This could be a portrait of someone who has lost someone important, or who is about to go through tough times. The artist has captured some of the details of the man's clothing perfectly, including the wrinkles on his forehead and around his eyes. The background is also very well-crafted, with intricate folds and patterns.
