This painting portrays a happy family gathering around a table. Spanning the surface of the canvas are twelve children, each seated at a different spot around the table, with their mothers seated to their left and fathers seated to their right. Each child has a full set of miniature adult furniture at their table, from chairs to candlesticks. The warm colors and lively depictions of children playing and interacting feel like a snapshot of life at that time, showing children enjoying their family and surroundings. The painting could be interpreted as a celebration of life, with the children representing the earliest stages of childhood, and the adults representing the lessons learned from those lessons.
