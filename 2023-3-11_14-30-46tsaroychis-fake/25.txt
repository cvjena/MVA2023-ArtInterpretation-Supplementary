The subject is seated with their back towards the viewer. They rest their arm on their bent knees, hand hidden behind their back. Though they are in profile, it is clear that they are a man with a strong, commanding presence. He is wearing a dark suit and appears to be gazing into the distance. In the background, there is a low ceiling dome and several lamps with bright light shining down, lending a feeling of warmth and light. This could be a representation of the artist's relationship with their muse, or simply the power and potential of art. The prominence of the subjectâ€™s figure gives the painting a sense of symbolic importance.
