Borodin was a Russian composer and pianist who is best known for his opera "Prince Igor". Borodin is pictured here with a musically inclined cigarette in hand, one that echoes the notes of the music he composed. He is wearing a serious expression and appears to be in thought. He is flanked by two musical instruments - a piano and violin. This painting may depict Borodin's dedication to his music and his passion for it. The color palette is muted, consisting mainly of browns, greys, and blacks, lending a sense of warmth and depth to the scene. The painting may commemorate Borodin's time in obscurity, and his dedication to his work.
