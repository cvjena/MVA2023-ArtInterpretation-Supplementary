This painting is a religious work of art depicting the Adoration of the Lamb, which is a scene from the Bible in which Jesus is adored by the Virgin and angels. The painting is set in a large, ornate church, with the gathered worshippers looking on in adoration at Jesus. The main focus of the painting is the lamb, which is shown to be dramatically different in color and scale to the other characters. The lamb is delicate and small, with a long shaggy coat and outstretched limbs, while the other figures are all rugged and muscular. This could suggest that the lamb is seen as the most important figure in the painting, and therefore the most deserving of the viewer's attention.
