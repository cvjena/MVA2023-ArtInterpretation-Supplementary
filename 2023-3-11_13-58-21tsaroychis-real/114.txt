This painting depicts a harbor in the Bay of Brest, Brittany, during the early 1900s. The bright colors, predominantly blue and yellow, make the painting appear inviting and cheerful. The boats and ships in the harbor create a busy and constantly changing scene. The long pier provides a stable base for the scene, while the shorelines and cliffs off in the distance add a natural element to the picture.  This painting might be interpreted as a snapshot of a happy moment in the life of the artist, or it could represent the excitement of the seaside town. The ships in the harbor could represent past travels, and the bright colors could symbolize the peace and prosperity of the town.
