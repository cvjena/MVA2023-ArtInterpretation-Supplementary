This painting features an overgrown forest with tall trees and tight spruce trees. The leaves are a deep green, and there is a lot of moss growing on the trees. The ground is covered in soft, green grass, and there are some small, black animals peeking out of the undergrowth. This painting could represent the tranquility and peace that the forest provides, as well as Van Gogh's love of nature. It could also be interpreted as a metaphor for the forests that the artist grew uphopping up from the wind. The dark green and brown colors could represent the forest's natural dangers, while the bright yellow animals could represent the sun's fire danger.
