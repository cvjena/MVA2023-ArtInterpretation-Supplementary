This painting is a vast and infinite landscape, with the sun setting in the distance and the sky turning a deep blue. There are hills and valleys, trees and plains visible in the painting, and it is almost as if you could walk out into the scene and explore it. The painting could represent the artist's own country, or perhaps it is an exploration of some kind of spiritual journey. It could also be interpreted as a symbol of the freedom and freedom to be human. There are so many different possibilities out there, and this painting is a few examples of what could be possible.
