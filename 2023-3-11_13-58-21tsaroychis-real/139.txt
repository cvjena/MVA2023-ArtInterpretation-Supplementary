The painting is set in a natural forest with a stream running by. The painting is full of green and brown leaves, with the trees being lit up by the light of the setting sun. There is a painting made up of a lot of different paintings, some of which are in the same color, some are in a different color and some are in a different color group. The painting in the center of the painting is a painting of a woman, probably Marna, looking out over the stream. She is wearing a long dress and has a regal look about her. The painting is brightly colored and it seems to be a very beautiful scene. It could be interpreted as a representation of the beauty of nature and the power of the sun.
