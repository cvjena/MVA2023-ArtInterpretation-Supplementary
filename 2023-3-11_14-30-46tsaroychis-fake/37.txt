This painting portrays the VirginMary bearing the Child Jesus, flanked by St. Dominic and St. Thomas Aquinas. It is likely that the three saints are representing the three stages of the Christian life: Childhood, Adolescence, and Maturity. The Virgin is seated in a meditative pose, with her eyes closed and her hands resting in her lap. Her features are serene and contemplative, while the Child's features are innocent and ingenuous. The figures are surrounded by a contemplative, softly glowing light. This painting is a testament to the power of prayer and the saintly influence that can be found in medieval religious art.
