The portrait is of a young woman, and the background is a dusky, smoky brown. It seems as if the light source is coming from behind the woman, revealing her profile and delicate features. The background appears to be moving, as if the artist is painting it from a moving subject.       There are many different interpretations that can be given for any artwork, depending on the expertise of the person providing the interpretation. Hopefully, this has helped give you a starting point for thinking about what might be possible when interpreting a painting. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. I would be happy to help, and I would be happy to provide a possible interpretation.
