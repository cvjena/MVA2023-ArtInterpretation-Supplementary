This painting depicts a tranquil landscape with a mill in the background. The sky is a clear blue and there is a hint of pink in the clouds. The mill is seen as a small, insignificant entity in the vast landscape, which could represent the innocence and tranquility that the artist hoped to bring to viewers. The woman working in the mill is a significant feature of the painting, providing some of the elements of the landscape that are in the foreground. She is surrounded by trees and appears to be in a state of peace. The painting could be interpreted as a representation of the peace that can be found in nature, as well as the fragile nature of life.
