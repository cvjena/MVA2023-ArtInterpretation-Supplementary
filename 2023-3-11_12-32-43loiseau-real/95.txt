The woman in this painting is sitting in a delicate dress with fine green threads. She seems to be looking away from the viewer, lost in thought or contemplation. The background is a indistinct green field. This painting may be interpreted in many ways, as the woman could represent any of a variety of different emotions or behaviors. The green field could represent the innocence and purity of the woman, while the woman itself could represent some kind of spiritual journey that she is undertaking. The woman could be gazing off into the distance, lost in thought or contemplation. Alternatively, the woman could be gazing at a world that is far away, and could represent the person's own inner journey.
