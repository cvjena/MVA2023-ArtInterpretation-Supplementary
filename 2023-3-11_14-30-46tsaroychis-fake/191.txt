This painting shows the Holy Trinity - the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The Virgin is standing between the two saints, and She is eagerly looking towards the Son, who is holding a book in His hands. Beneath her feet is a youthful Christ Child, who is holding a flower. Behind the Virgin and the saints, can be seen a profusely flowering tree. This could symbolize the life-giving blessings of the Trinity. Above the tree, a brilliant light can be seen, perhaps representing the divine light of the Son. This painting is a beautiful example of the importance of religion and its ability to bring together the different classes of society. It is also a powerful reminder of the importance of faith and freedom.
