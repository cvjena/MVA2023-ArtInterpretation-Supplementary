This painting is a depiction of the Virgin Mary nursing the infant Jesus. She wear a ring with a curved oval shape on herfinger. Just as with all religious paintings, what is portrayed in this work is not just a spiritual matter, but a physical one as well. The ring is a physical representation of the spiritual energy which sustains the babe, ensuring his protection and safeguarding him from harm. Denis utilised muted colors to create a tone of reverence. The viewer is left to ponder what it might mean to be entrusted with the care of a child, and to look to the Mother of God for guidance.
