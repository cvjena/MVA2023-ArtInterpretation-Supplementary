The painting is set in a meadow, with a stream running through it. The shapes of the leaves and the flowers are mostly soft colors, with a few areas of brighter colors. The sky is a light blue, and the sun is just setting. This is a very tranquil painting, with peaceful colors and a peaceful environment. It could be interpreted as a portrait of the artist's family, or it could be interpreted as a scenographic painting. It could also be interpreted as a commentary on the art world, or a commentary on the art world whitewashed around us.
