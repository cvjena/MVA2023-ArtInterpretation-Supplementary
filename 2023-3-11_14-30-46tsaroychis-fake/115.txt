The painting features a tranquil scene of a riverbank with a tree standing in the foreground. The river is depicted as a wide, slow-moving stream, with a bank that gradually slopes upwards. The sky is a deep blue, and there is a bright, full moon visible in the night sky. The painting is classic French Impressionist style, with a subdued palette of only a few colors, and Signac's signature soft, soothing brushstrokes. This painting could represent Signac's personal view of nature and how it can tranquillize and inspire him. The tranquility of the scene could be a metaphor for his own peaceful life.
