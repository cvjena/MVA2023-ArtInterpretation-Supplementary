The painting is a wide, sweeping overview of the village of Selemecb on the banks of the VÃ¡h River. The river is visible in the distance and the village is nestled among the wooded hills. The landscape is peaceful and pastoral, with bright green fields and gentle blue hued houses. Near the village, there are mills and a church.  This painting represents Csontvary's love of his home village and the peaceful beauty of the Hungarian countryside. He may have painted it as a testament to the villagers and the life they had there. The view of the village from the village may also be a representation of his heart.
