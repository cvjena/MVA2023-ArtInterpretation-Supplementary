The painting is set on a brightly lit street where people are enjoying a drink or a picnic. There is a well in the foreground with brightly colored flowers growing on it. The background is a warm, blue-green and the sky is a lively, bright blue. In the distance, you can see a few houses on the street. There are several people in the painting, but they are not very clear. One of them is a man, and he is looking at the woman in the background. The woman is wearing a dress that looks like it is flowing out, and she has her hands in her lap. The man in the background is wearing a dark blue hat and he is looking down at the ground.
