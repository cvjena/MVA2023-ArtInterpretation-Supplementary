This painting captures the beauty and peacefulness of the banks of the Marne River at Cennevieres. The neatly trimmed hedgerows and the gently rustling trees are a refreshing contrast to the overwhelming turmoil of the battlefield just a few miles away. The blue of the sky and the water are both a calming, peaceful color. The pastoral setting could be interpreted as a metaphor for the peacefulness and serenity of the French countryside. The painting could also be interpreted as a commentary on the Franco-Prussian War, in which the two countries were fighting each other bloody battles. The battlefield in the background is possibly representing the battlefield in Cennevieres.
