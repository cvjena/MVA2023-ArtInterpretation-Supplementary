This painting is a study of light and shadow. The figure in the center is lit by a light shining from the right, while the shadow of the figure falls towards the left. This creates a seemingly three-dimensional effect. The background is mostly a dark, inky color, and the lightest areas of it are highlighted by a light blue hue. This can be interpreted as suggesting that the light bringing the figure into focus is from outside of the painting, while the shadow emanating from the figure represents the darker emotions that the individual is feeling.   The interpretation of this painting could be that the light represents the emotions that the individual is feeling, and the dark represents the emotions that they are feeling.
