The sitter is portrayed as an intelligent, strong-willed individual. He has calmly studied the viewer and is holding a piece of paper in his left hand, possibly showing the result of his analysis. The harsh, flat colors in the painting may represent either his intellectual steadfastness or his unbending convictions. The angular, stark lines in the painting might also allude to the harshness of his reality. The deep, rich colors might also suggest either his inner strength or his inner anger. The focal point of the painting is the brilliant, penetrating blue in the man's eyes. This centerpiece, combined with the intense, glowing colors and the dramatic setting, might suggest either his powerful personality or his cold, hard life.
