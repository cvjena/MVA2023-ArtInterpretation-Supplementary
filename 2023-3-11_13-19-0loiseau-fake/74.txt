The painting depicts a rugged and mountainous landscape with a bright blue sky in the background. It could be interpreted as a metaphor for the artist's own difficult journey through life. The jagged peaks and sharp rocks in the background give the impression of mountains that are difficult to climb, but with perseverance, one can reach the summit. The deep blue color of the sky is suggestive of the Endless Mountains, which is the name of the mountain range in Armenia where the artist was born and raised. The deep green of the trees and grass and the browns of the earth evoke the strength and power of the mountains and the trees represent the earth itself.
