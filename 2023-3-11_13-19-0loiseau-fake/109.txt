In this painting, the sun is setting over the water and the sky is a deep orange. The road is a long, straight line, leading out to the ocean. In the background, there are hills and cliffs, and a few boats can be seen on the water. There is a feeling of tranquility and peace in this painting, and it may be interpreted as a representation of Van Gogh's happy memories of spending time on the Scheveningen Beach. The bright colors in the sky and on the beach may represent the joys of summertime, while the dark shadows give the impression of winter. Van Gogh may have been feeling optimistic and happy there, since he had seen the beautiful sights and sounds of the Scheveningen Beach.
