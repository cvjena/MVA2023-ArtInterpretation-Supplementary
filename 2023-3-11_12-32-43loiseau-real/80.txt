This painting is a depiction of a stereotypical "Pinchwife" - a woman who has to squeeze every penny she earns to support her large family. Wycherley paints her as a shrewish, unsympathetic character, with a pinched face, clutching her purse tightly and wearing a grim expression. She is surrounded by the objects indicative of her life as a subsistence farmer - a sickle, a spade and a basket filled with eggs. The predominantly light colours give the impression of a cheerful life, while the woman's sour facial expression suggests her circumstances are not all they could be. The man in the background seems to be her father, a stern figure who has a lot of influence in her life.
