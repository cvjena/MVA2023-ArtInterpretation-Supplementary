This painting is a landscape of rolling hills, gradually rising until they meet in the sky, where a swath of brilliant blue sky punctuates the horizon. A river winds its way through the landscape, marked by willows and a few bits of farmland here and there. In the distance is a range of mountains, while above the landscape the sky lightens to a gradual pink.  A possible interpretation of this painting could be that it is a representation of the natural wonders of Russia and the wide open plains it is home to. The bright blue sky and pink sunrise could represent the hope and promise of the upcoming season. The pastoral setting and inclusion of the river could suggest the fertility and life of the land.
