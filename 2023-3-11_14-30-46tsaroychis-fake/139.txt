This painting depicts a pastoral scene of rolling hills in the distance and a small building on the right. Nearby, there is a tree with a flock of Ibises perched on its branches. The landscape is beautifully rendered and provides a tranquil backdrop for the figures. The blue of the sky and the green of the landscape are strikingly beautiful, making this a beautiful piece to look at. It could be interpreted as a representation of the natural world, which is constantly changing and providing a place to others. The painting could also be seen as a metaphor for the freedom and peace that the artist experienced during his lifetime.
