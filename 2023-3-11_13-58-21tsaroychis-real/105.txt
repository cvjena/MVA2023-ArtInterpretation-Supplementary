This painting is of a group of fishing boats painted in the middle of the sea. The boats are brightly painted with a palette consisting of blue, green, and yellow. They are silhouetted against the bright sky blue and the green of the vegetation. The boats appear to be waiting for someone or something to dock them at the shore. This could be a reference to the fact that fishermen travel to the sea to catch fish. The boats are brightly painted with a palette consisting of blue, green, and yellow.
