This painting is about movement and transformation. The brightly colored birds are in the process of starting to fly, and the air is filled with the smell of feathers and flowers. The soft pink and yellow feathers are silhouetted against the sky, and the waves in the background suggest the movement of the birds. This work could be interpreted as a symbol of freedom and soaring. The freedom and excitement in the bird movements could be a reflection of the artist's own optimism and aspirations. Alternatively, it could be seen as a simple depiction of beauty and simplicity. Regardless of the artist's work, it is a beautiful and delicate piece.
