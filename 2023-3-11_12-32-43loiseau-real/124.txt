Frans Hals was a Dutch Golden Age painter who specialized in paintings of everyday life. This painting is a self portrait, and is one of the few paintings of Hals that is signed. He is depicted wearing a hooded cloak and a conical hat, and looks sternly out at the viewer. He was known for his delicate facial features and energetic, expressive brushstrokes, and this painting is a perfect example of his skill. This painting could be interpreted as capturing the essence of a powerful, domineering male figure. It could also be interpreted as a commentary on the power and privilege of the upper class. The painting could be seen as a snapshot of a happy, carefree moment in Dutch history.
