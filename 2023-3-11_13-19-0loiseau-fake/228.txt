The sitter, Louise Delphine Duchosal, is depicted as a young and beautiful woman. She has her eyes closed, as if in a deep concentration, and her hands are resting in her lap. Her delicate features, surrounded by a delicate halo of hair, are captured in a moment of peace and stillness. Ferdinand Hodler was known for his portraits of women, which typically portrayed them as unabashedly feminine and beautiful, without any traces of the grit and determination that characterizes so many women in history. This painting could be interpreted as a portrayal of the artist's admiration and respect for Louise, who was a significant female figure in Ottoman Turkey.
