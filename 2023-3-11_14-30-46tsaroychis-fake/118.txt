The painting is set against a brightly lit riverbank. The viewer can see the reflections of trees and other Objects in the water. A possible interpretation could be that the painting represents the hope and potential of mankind, represented by the trees and the bright light on the horizon. The bright light also represents the potential for good, represented by the boats. The painting could also be interpreted as a metaphor for the journey of life, with the trees representing growth and life, and the light representing the sky. It could also be interpreted as a metaphor for the seasons, with the trees representing life, and the light representing the seasons.
