This painting depicts a lone tree standing in a vast and open field, with a blue sky in the background. The tree is bordered by a low fence, and the viewer can see a few small houses in the distance. The tree seems to be leaning backwards, as if it might fall over. This could be representing the feeling of loneliness that the artist may have been experiencing at the time. The blue could also be representing the sky, which was often blue in color during that time. The white could be representing the snow, which is usually a cold day. The yellow could be representing the sun, which is usually a warm color. The yellow could also represent the hues of the buildings and snow.
