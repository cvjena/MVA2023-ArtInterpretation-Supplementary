This painting portrays a pastoral scene of a shepherd and his flock of sheep. It is probably inspired by views of the Arda Valley in Ukraine, which Aivazovsky visited in 1876. The bright colors and the gently swelling hills give the painting a feeling of serenity and peace. The sheep are grazing contentedly and the shepherd is watching them attentively. The painting is dominated by the deep blue of the sky and the reflections of the sun on the water. This is a very soothing view, and it is likely that Aivazovsky chose to depict it here because it is a central part of Russian culture. The muted colors give the painting a timeless quality, and it is a beautiful reminder of the beauty of nature.
