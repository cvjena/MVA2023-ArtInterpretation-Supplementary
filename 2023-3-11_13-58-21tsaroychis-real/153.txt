The painting is of a valley in the Arges Mountains in Romania, and as the title suggests, it depicts the landscape and the surrounding countryside. The cloudy sky, highlighted by a few bright spots, gives the impression of evening, while the deep blue of the ocean suggests the middle of the night. The rugged landscape, with its tall, snow-capped mountains in the background, is reminiscent of a winter scene. The serenity of the scene is reflected in the natural beauty of the landscape, and the softly-lit sky, lending the impression of peace. The painting could be interpreted as a snapshot of a tranquil time, or as a description of the progression of winter.
