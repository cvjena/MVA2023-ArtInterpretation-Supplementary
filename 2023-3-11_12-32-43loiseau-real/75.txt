This oil painting features a stern-looking man with a defined jaw and a dark beard. His features are perhaps too harsh and appear masculine, with no hint of friendliness. It is likely that he is a Russian statesman, either Prime Minister or Minister of War, given his grooming and clothing. In his left hand he is clutching a bronze statuette of a ram, a sign of power and wealth. The painting is set in an elaborate, neoclassical-style room with finely carved marble columns and elaborate plasterwork. It could be interpreted as a commentary on the horrors of war. The man in the painting could be a statesman of some sort, overseeing what he oversees with the utmost respect and authority.
