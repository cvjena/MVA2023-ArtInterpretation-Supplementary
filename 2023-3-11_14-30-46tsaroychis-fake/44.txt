The painting is mainly composed of light and dark browns and greys, with a light blue sky and a light brown Madonna and Child. The Madonna is seated with her hands in her lap, while the Child is standing and holds a small cross in his left hand. They appear to be looking down at someone or something in front of them, and the viewer's eye is immediately drawn to the Child's face, which is finely detailed and strikingly life-like. This is a powerful and emotive work, which is full of religious symbolism. It is possible to see the Madonna as a representation of Mary, the mother of Jesus, and the Child as a representation of Christ himself.
