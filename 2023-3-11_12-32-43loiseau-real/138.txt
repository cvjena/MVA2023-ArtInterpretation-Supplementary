This painting is a religious image that is supposed to depict the Virgin Mary, who is clutching a child in her left hand, and saint Ursula, seen in the background holding a staff with a snake wrapped around it. The snake may allude to the fact that Saint Ursula was martyred for her faith. The colors in the painting are muted, with shades of blue, green, and brown dominating, and the artwork is primarily focused on the details and textures in the figures and their clothing. This painting may be interpreted as a celebration of both the Virgin Mary and St Ursula, and their successes in overcoming obstacles.
