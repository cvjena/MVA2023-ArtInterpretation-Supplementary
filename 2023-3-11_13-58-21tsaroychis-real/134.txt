This painting is of a winding country road in the foothills of the Portuguese Alps. The painting appears to be lit by the light of the setting sun, drenched in golden rays that stream down through the trees and across the landscape. The road is made up of a series of small ditches and ruts, which highlight the ruggedness of the landscape. Some of the trees have grown slightly taller than the others, and appear to be reaching up towards the sky; this gives the impression of a mountainside that is reaching out towards the heavens. In the foreground, there is a small stand of trees, and in the background is a hill covered in forestry.
