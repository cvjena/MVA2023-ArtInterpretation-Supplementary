The portrait is of a man in his late 30s or early 40s, probably Russian. He has a stern, determined expression, and his light brown hair is pulled back into a bun. He is wearing a long, traditional Russian dress, including a long scarf wrapped around his neck. He looks like a man of distinction and responsibility, someone who would be able to command respect. The painting has a very old-fashioned look, with familiarity and familiarity being provided to the viewer. In the background, there is a bed, possibly of someone who has visited the man in hospital. This could be a representation of the man's own hospital, which at that time was often very therapeutic.
