This art piece uses several colors to create a phantasmagoric image. The dress is a deep maroon, in the center of the piece is a bright yellow, and near the bottom is a bright lime green. The colors are arranged in a swirl around the dress, reflecting the chaos and vibrancy of life. The dress is partially transparent, lending the illusion of movement and life. The depiction of food is a satirical commentary on the idea of gluttony and excess. This is one of Warhol's most famous paintings, and it is popularly considered one of the most important works of Pop Art.
