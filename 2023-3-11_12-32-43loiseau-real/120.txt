The painting is a cacophonous and chaotic mixture of objects. There is a seating area with a couple of people in it, a pile of clothes, a weapon and various other objects. In the foreground is an overturned vat of hot tar. Beside it is a large pile of paving stones. It seems as if the butts were set there as an accident, or to deliberately disrupt the orderly surroundings. Blake used a technique called magic realism to add asense of the supernatural to the painting. This makes the objects appear like they are really there because they are just scattered around, but there is also a sense of mystery and intrigue as you look at them.
