This painting features a powerful and regal Virgin Mary holding the Christ Child, who is facing forward and gazing at the viewer. Saint Anne, standing to the Virgin's left, supports the Child with her left arm, while Saint John, facing the viewer directly, holds a book in his right hand and a cross in his left. This masterpiece of Italian Renaissance art emanates an intense and spiritual presence, thanks in part to the artist's use of natural light and muted colors. This may depict a scene from the Bible in which Saint Anne extricates the Christ from the mouth of the demon Serapion, and Saint John presents the Child to the Virgin.
