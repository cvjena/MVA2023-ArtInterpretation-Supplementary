The painting is set in the hills of Auvers-sur-Oise, near Paris. It is a idyllic scene, with a river running through the area and a cluster of buildings in the distance. The colors are very muted, with a light blue sky and a few clouds. There is a sense of peace and tranquility here, thanks to the painter's beautiful use of color. This could be a representation of the artist's feelings of love and happiness, in contrast to the turmoil of city life. The pastoral scenery could also be a reference to the artist's home country, France. This could be a reflection of his love for the area and its people.
