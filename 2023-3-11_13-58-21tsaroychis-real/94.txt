This painting is a tranquil and serene view of a lakeside house. The green grass, the blue water, and the white homes in the distance all take on a soothing, ethereal quality under the soft light of the setting sun. The painted landscape seems almost fragile, as if it could easily be swept away by a gust of wind. The house itself is brightly painted, and appears to be surrounded by a beautiful garden. It is possible to imagine a relaxing afternoon spent lounging in the comfortable surroundings of this charming house. The painting could also be interpreted as a snapshot of a happy life, with the homecoming celebration marking the end of the world.
