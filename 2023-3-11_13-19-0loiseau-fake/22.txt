The trees in this painting appear to be rooted in the earth but are also reaching up towards the sky, as if they are begging for rain. The leaves are a deep, rich green and the trees are decorated with patches of bright orange and yellow. The sun is setting in the background and gives the entire painting an orange tinge. This is a beautiful, peaceful picture and would be great for someone who loves nature scenes.  There are many possible interpretations of paintings, but one could see this painting as a representation of the power of the artist and the beauty of the natural world. It could be interpreted as a celebration of life, and a hope for the future.
