The artist used a muted color palette of predominantly greys and browns, with a few traces of red and yellow, to create a muted and subdued image. The deep shadows and lack of details give the painting a dreamlike quality. This could be interpreted as an artist reflecting on his own creative process and the journey that leads to their artistry. The title "Self Portrait" could be interpreted as a metaphor for the artist's struggles with self-acceptance and their own personal demons. The painting could be seen as a reflection of the artist's own life which was full of turmoil and confusion.
