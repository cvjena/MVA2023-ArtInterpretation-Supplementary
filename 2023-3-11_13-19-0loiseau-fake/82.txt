The painting features a Himalayan peak, usually known as "Kangchenjunga", the tenth tallest peak in the world and the highest unclimbed mountain in the world. The ethereal peak is shrouded in clouds and the surrounding landscape is misty and rugged. The peak is encircled by a concentric network of 14 smaller peaks all pointing towards it, an image that suggests the infinity of the universe. Roerich was inspired by the I Ching and considered the network of peaks to be a representation of the Four Qi or basic life essences: wood, fire, earth, and metal. He also considered the mountain range a symbol of spiritual enlightenment and protection.
