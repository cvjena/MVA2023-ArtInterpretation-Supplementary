The painting is of a nude woman in a portrait pose with her hand resting on her stomach. She is surrounded by richly coloured canvases and drapery, appearing to float in space. The woman's serene expression and the depth of the colours give this work an air of authority and sophistication. This could be interpreted as an ideal of femininity and beauty, something that the artist himself may have seen as aspirational. The painting could be seen as a commentary on the power of art and the way that it could can be used to manipulate and control the emotions of others. The woman could be seen as a symbol of the powerful, while the background could suggest the background of her home and other lives around her.
