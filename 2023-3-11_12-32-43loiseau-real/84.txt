This painting depicts a woman sitting up in bed with her back to the viewer. She is wearing a dressing gown and has her hands folded in her lap. She is looking off to the side, and has a serious, contemplative expression on her face. This painting is a beautiful example of the 16th century Dutch painting style, and is likely a depiction of the woman's life story. It's possible that she is a wealthy lady, and that the bed in which she is sitting represents her wealth. Alternatively, she could be a courtesan, and the bed could represent the luxurious lifestyle she enjoys. The painting is colorful and imaginative, and would be perfect for a bedroom or living room.
