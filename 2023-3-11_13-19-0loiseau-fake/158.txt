The subject of the painting is a couple in the throes of passion. They are in the swing, swaying back and forth, their energy and passion transferring to the viewer. The bright colours in the background create a cheerful atmosphere, contrasting with the intense love making in the foreground. The diagonal lines radiating out from the couple create an optical illusion that makes the viewer feel as if they are actually in the swing with them. The painting could be interpreted as a celebration of love, and a metaphor for the fleeting nature of love. Moralis uses light and shadow to create a sense of depth and dimension to his paintings, making them seem very real. This painting is a beautiful representation of passion and its power to bring people together.
