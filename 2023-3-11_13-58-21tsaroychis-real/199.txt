This portrait is of a wealthy and successful gentleman, possibly depicting Francis Rawdon Hastings as a younger man. He appears very handsome with a sharpened angular face, prominent nose, and deep-set eyes that seem to pierce straight into your soul. He has a hard, determined look about him and seems to be in complete control of his surroundings. The white silk dress he is wearing sets off his pale complexion and the ornate necklace and boutonniere give him a regal look. This painting could be interpreted as a representation of power and privilege, conveying the message that he is in control of his own life and can do anything he sets his mind to.
