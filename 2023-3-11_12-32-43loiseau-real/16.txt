The flowers in this painting are colorful and all have different shapes, sizes, and colors, making the composition seem more dynamic and lively. The brightly colored flowers are in an even mix across the painting, without any dominant colors. This makes the painting seem more fresh and new. There is a sense of symmetry to the composition, but it is not too perfect, giving the painting a slightly natural feel. There is also a sense of balance and order in the painting, which gives it a sense of beauty and harmony. The artist may have been alluding to the idea of order and structure, in the nature of things. He may have been trying to show that nature is always changing and growing, while still leaving room for interpretation.
