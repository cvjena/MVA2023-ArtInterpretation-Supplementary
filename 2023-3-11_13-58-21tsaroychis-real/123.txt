This painting is of a bright, sandy coastline. It appears to be early in the morning, as the sun just begins to peek over the horizon. The sky is a deep, vivid blue, while the sea is a deep,royal blue. There is a sand beach at the far end of the shoreline, with a few small waves crashfully lapping against it. Atop the beach, there is a single, small house, with a few trees nearby. It is a peaceful, tranquil image, and would make a perfect background for a serene wedding photographer.  A possible interpretation of this painting could be that it is a depiction of the beauty and peacefulness of the ocean, and the night sky.
