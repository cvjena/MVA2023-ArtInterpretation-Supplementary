This painting is about the Jewish people and their connection to the temple. The women are appearing to be in a state of reverie, looking off into the distance and may represent the Jewish people's connection to the temple. The predominant color in the painting is blue, which symbolizes the sky and heavens. The luminous figures in the background are probably representations of the divine. The painting is ethereal and dreamlike, with a underlying spiritual message. The women may represent the faith and faithfulness of the Jewish people to their religion. The temple could be interpreted as a representation of the Jewish faith and its traditions. The painting could also be interpreted as a commentary on the persecution of the Jews in Europe at that time.
