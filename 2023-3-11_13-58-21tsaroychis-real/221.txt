This is a self portrait of the artist, in which he appears to be in his early 20s. He has a deeply thoughtful expression and is wearing a fashionable three-quarter-length jacket and silk scarf. He appears to be holding a book in his hands, possibly a copy of Virgil's Georgics. Behind him, you can see a rooftop with neoclassical architecture, and in the background a river flows. This painting could represent the artist's high aspirations and aspirations to be a great scholar. It could also symbolize the depth and richness of the artist's personal life.  There are many possible interpretations of any painting, as the artist's intent is never fully crystal clear.
