This painting is a study of a human head. The eyes, eyebrows and hair are finely drawn and painted with great attention to detail. The skin appears almost luminous. The features are classic, with a strong chin and a natural expression. The man appears to be in his early twenties and might be Russian. He might be a peasant or a clergyman. He might be reading or writing. He is wearing a traditional Russian dress, including a long dress with a high collar and a long sleeves. This painting is a beautiful example of classic Russian art. The man's clothing and the landscape behind him are also very typical Russian clothing. This painting would be a beautiful addition to any home.
