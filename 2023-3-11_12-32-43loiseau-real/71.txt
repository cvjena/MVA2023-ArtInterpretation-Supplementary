The portrait is of a distinguished-looking man with a severe expression. He might be a statesman or perhaps a businessman. His costume is sober, with a high collar and a long, full coat. In his left hand he holds a quill, possibly signifying his profession as a writer. The light behind him casts a halo around his head, giving the impression of an aura of authority and power. The background is a heavily patterned white, with a few hints of green, and delineate some loose edges. This suggests that the man is in a formal setting, possibly a park. There is a strong sense of quiet solitude and quiet calm.
