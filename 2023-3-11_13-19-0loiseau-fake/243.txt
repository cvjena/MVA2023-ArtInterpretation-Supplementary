This painting is of a woman in a chair looking out a window. She is holding a bouquet of flowers, and the painting has a pastoral feel to it. The woman is posed in a very natural way, with her hands in her lap and her head tilted down, suggesting she is lost in thought. The light streaming in through the window casts a bright glow on the woman's face, highlighting her features and giving her a glowing appearance. The flowers in the bouquet are a lovely feature, adding a touch of color and life to the painting.   There is a possibility that this painting could be interpreted as depicting the woman's life as a mother, or as a woman who is looking out for her own happiness and interests.
