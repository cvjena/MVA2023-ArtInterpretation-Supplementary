This painting could be interpreted as a metaphor for the artist's life. The ambulance is on its way to hospital, and the doctor is coming back from hospital. The ambulance is filled to the capacity, but the doctor is wearing a military-style uniform and has a medical staff member on staff nearby. The ambulance is moving slowly, and the smoke from the medical staff rises up in the background. The painting is full of action and emotions, and it could be seen as a representation of the artist's life. The painting could also be seen as a metaphor for the artist's work and for the society in which he lived. The ambulance is a messenger, and the medical staff are sent to help people in need.
