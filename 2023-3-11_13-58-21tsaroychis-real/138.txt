The painting depicts a dense forest with a river running through it. The trees are tall and reach up to the sky, blocking out the light of the sun. The river flows slowly through the forest and the banks are steep, making the scenery look dramatic. There is a feeling of peace and serenity in the painting, and it could be interpreted as a representation of the artist's feelings of despair and disillusionment. The autumn season is a time of change and growth, and this painting could be seen as a representation of that period. It could be seen as a reflection of Van Gogh's personal struggles at the time.
