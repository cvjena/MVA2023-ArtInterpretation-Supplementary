The painting features a beautiful religious subject, with the Madonna and Child surrounded by angels. In the background is a beautiful, brightly lit church, while in the foreground is a figure of a young girl, possibly St Rufina herself, praying. The skin is a luminous pale blue color,signifying the purity and peace of the subject. The angels are all wearing richly colorful robes, which provide a bursting of color and life in the otherwise austere setting. This painting could be seen as a representation of the Madonna and Child's hope for salvation and salvation for all, regardless of their religious affiliation. The timeless and sublime nature of the work could also be interpreted as a reflection of the eternal nature of the Christchild.
