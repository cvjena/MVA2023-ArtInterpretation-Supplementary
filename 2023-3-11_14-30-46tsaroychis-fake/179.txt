This painting is an impressive picture of a deer in a forest. The deer is surrounded by lush green forest and the background is filled with a bright blue sky. The deer has a calmly looking chin, with its large eyes brightened by the setting sun, to give it a ethereal look. The deer is posed in a graceful pose, with its head high and its eyes looking straight forward. This painting is a naturalistic depiction of nature, and it is likely that the artist was inspired by the beauty of the forest to create this charming picture. In next to the deer, there is a small building, possibly a barn, which stands in the middle of the forest.
