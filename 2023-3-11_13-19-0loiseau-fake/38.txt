In this painting, the forest appears to be alive with movement. The trees seem to be swaying back and forth with the wind, and the grass is waving in the same direction. The leaves are a brilliant green, and the contrast against the dark background is stunning. It is as if you are looking at a scene out of a fantasy book. The center of the painting is dominated by a large tree, which might be interpreted as the tree of life in the Christian mythology. It is possible that the tree is a symbol for growth, and that the movement of the trees is a representation of the eternal nature of the world. The painting is brightly lit, and it looks like it would be a very sunny day.
