This painting features a series of Mercury's helmets that were worn by Greek Athena in the Trojan War. It is a beautiful piece of art that would add a touch of majesty to the composition. The helmets are lit from behind, giving them an ethereal look. The sky in the background is a deep, rich blue, and the helmets are lit from the inside by a single light. This could be interpreted as a representation of the divine power that is hovering over the gods and goddesses. The light and darkness are both controlled by the eyes of the god or goddess, and the overall effect is of calm victory.
