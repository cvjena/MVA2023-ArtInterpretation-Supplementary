The painting is of a church in the town of Gustynia, in what is now central Ukraine. The church is one of the most important religious sites in the region, and Shevchenko spent a great deal of time painting it. The painting is full of detail and shows the church from multiple angles. It has a solemn, almost reverent mood, and is typical of Shevchenko's depictions of religious architecture. Some possible interpretations could include that the church is a symbol of the spiritual journey that the protagonist is undertaking, or that it is a sign of hope and salvation.
