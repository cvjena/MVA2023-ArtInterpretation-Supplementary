In this painting, the artist showcases his skillful use of perspective and light.Three figures are positioned on a hillside, casting long shadows on the surrounding landscape. The dark figures appear to be advancing, while the lighter ones retreat; this creates a sense of tension and drama. The bright oranges and yellows in the sky create a naturalistic effect, while the reflections in the water add depth and texture.  A possible interpretation of this painting could be that the artist is depicting the power and resilience of nature. The peacefulness and beauty of nature is evident in the abundance of food and shelter that can provide such a facility. The violence and fragility of life can also be destructive.
