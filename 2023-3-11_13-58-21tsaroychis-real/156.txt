This painting portrays a tranquil scene looking out on a large, still lake. The water is a light blue, and the reflections off the surface make it look like there is a layer of ice over the lake. The shoreline is rocky and the trees that line the lake provide a protective barrier from the rest of the world. The painting has a very serene and peaceful feeling to it, and is likely meant to evoke a sense of peace and tranquility.   A possible interpretation of " lake " by Konstantin Korovin could be that it represents the tranquility and beauty that can be found in nature, even during times of turmoil.
