This painting features a man in a formal yet relaxed attire. He could be a teacher, dignitary, or maybe he is just taking a leisurely break between tasks. The light in his eyes lends an air of understanding and maturity. He could be quoting Aristotle or pope while sipping coffee. The man's skin has a natural glow and the detail in the painting is exquisite. The composition is simple, yet effective. The man in this painting seems to be floating in space, towards the viewer. He could be a symbol of transition, of eternal life. The pope is seated in the front, looking down at the man. He is flanked by two small angels, who are watching over the man.
