The Annunciation is a religious painting produced in the mid 15th century and is housed in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy. It is a quadratura, or four-rounded, composition with a central halo and a floor decorated with a double row of Corinthian columns. The figures within the painting are reported to be the direct ancestors of the Benvenuto Cellini family.  The angel Gabriel is shown approaching the Virgin Mary, who is lying on a bed arranged in a triangular shape with her left hand extended. Above the bed is a blue vaulted ceiling with a cornice, while the lower segment of the painting is enclosed by a wooden railing.
