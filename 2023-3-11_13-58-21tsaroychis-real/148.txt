The painting is set in a bucolic setting with trees, a river and a small cottage in the distance. The cottage is slowly being consumed by the encroaching forest, suggesting its transient nature. The expansive sky dominates the scene, showing the painter's interest in exploring the heavens. The yellow and orange hues of the sun and the vast blue of theå¤© suggest the warmth of the emotions being portrayed. The figure of a woman in the foreground may be a representation of the artist's wife or wife-to-be, as she gazes wistfully at her own reflection in the window. The painting may be interpreted as a depiction of the artist's own life, in which he feels at peace and surrounded by beauty.
