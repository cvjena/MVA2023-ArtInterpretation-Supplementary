In this painting, the artist seems to be commenting on the state of contemporary society, where people are always rushing around, and rarely slow down to look at what's in front of them. The couple in the painting are facing the camera, and their interactions are a microcosm of the society around them. The woman is looking away, while the man seems to be doing most of the conversation; he's looking down into her eyes and she seems to be looking away from him. In the background, there are a few objects, but they're all in a hurry - the man is carrying a briefcase, and the woman has a folder.
