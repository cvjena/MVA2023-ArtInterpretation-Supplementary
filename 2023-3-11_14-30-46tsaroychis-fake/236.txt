This painting is a devotional work that was created in the early 15th century to honor the Virgin Mary. The main subject is the Tabernacle, or Ark of the Covenant, which is situated in the Temple in Jerusalem. It is made of gilded wood, with a triangular roof and seven panels depicting the seven deadly sins (Pride, Envy, Wrath, Sloth, Gluttony, Lust, and Greed). The central panel is flanked by the Evangelists Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, each holding a book. Above them is a statue of the Virgin Mary, with the Child Jesus in her arms.
