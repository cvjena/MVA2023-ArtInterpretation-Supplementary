The painting is set in a cruciform-shaped space and features Christ suspended between two stylized pillars, with a crowd of men and women below. The painting is vibrant with color, and features a complex composition with a range of tones. The viewer can see both the chains and the nails protruding from Christ's hands and feet, as well as the blood raining down on the figures below. Christ is portrayed as triumphant, with a determined look on his face. This is a religious and political painting that depicts the triumph of the Christian faith against oppressive forces. It could be interpreted as a representation of the divine throne, or of the power of the Church.
