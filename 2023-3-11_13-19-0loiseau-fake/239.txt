This painting is of a young woman sitting on a window seat, reading a book. There is a further window seat beside her and behind her is a garden. The light comes in through the window and reflects off the pages of the book, giving the impression of floating objects. The girl is well-dressed and bourgeois, typical of the Belle Epoque. She is content and peaceful, but something in the background of the painting suggests she may not be quite happy. The window seat and the flowers behind it may be a sign of wealth and prosperity, but the girl seems to be struggling to make ends meet. This is a timeless painting that will remain vibrant and beautiful for centuries to come.
