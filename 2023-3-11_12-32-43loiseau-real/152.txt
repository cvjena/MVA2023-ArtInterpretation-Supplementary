This painting features a forebodingisland scene with the snow-capped mountains in the background and a threatening, dark storm sky. The stark white of the painting contrasts sharply with the deep dark green of the trees and the dark blue of the sky. The painting is very dense with details, and it is difficult to tell what is happening in the foreground. Some people might see a ship in the distance, while others might see a tempestuous river flowing through the landscape. It could be interpreted as a painting of fear and darkness, or as a painting of political commentary. The painting could also be interpreted as a commentary on the dangers of war.
