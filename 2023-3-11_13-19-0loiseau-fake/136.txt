This painting is made up of rolling hills with a thick forest of trees in the background. A river flows through the painting, appearing as a ribbon of blue and white. In the foreground is a large house set atop a small hill, with a small patch of vegetation nearby. The painting is peaceful, and appears to depict a place that the artist loves. Carmichael was known for his expressive landscapes, and this painting could be interpreted as a snapshot of a moment in time. It could be a scene from the natural world that he observed while he was painting, or it could be a representation of life as it is lived in the world.
