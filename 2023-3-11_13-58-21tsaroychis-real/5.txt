This painting could be interpreted in a number of ways, but in my opinion, it portrays a woman who is not at all comfortable in her own skin. The woman is sitting naked, with her back to the viewer, and she has an egg clutched in her hands. The egg could represent her biology, her sexuality, or her own fears. The woman's expression is uneasy, as if she is feeling trapped or unsafe. The background behind her is mostly dark, with just a few patches of light streaking across it. This could represent the dark world she lives in, or her own fears.       There is something unsettling about this painting.
