This painting is about the passage of time, and how it can sometimes be difficult to tell the difference between what is real and what is simply an illusory product of our imagination. The painting contains lush greens and blues, hinting at the changing seasons. However, the trees themselves seem to be frozen in time, eternally standing tall and unchanging. The deep green of the trees and the ice blue of the sky give the painting a ethereal quality. It could be interpreted as a metaphor for the eternal cycle of life and death. In the foreground is a simple, stark landscape strewn with barren trees and snow-capped mountains. This barren setting could be a reference to the frozenness of life and the transient nature of existence.
