The man\'s features are perfectly captured, from his strong brow to his finely sculpted nose and mouth. He may be wearing a robe or perhaps a tunic, and his hair may be long and unkempt. This is a beautiful and timeless portrait, perfect for a home or office.  There are many possible interpretations of paintings, and the interpretation given depends on the expertise of the art historian providing the interpretation.
