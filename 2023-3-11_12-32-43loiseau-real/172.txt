This painting is a religious representation of the apostles in glory, with Thomas in the middle. He is flanked by St Mark and St Louis of Toulouse, and is shown in a moment of intense prayer. The bright colours and intense light shining down on Thomas suggest that he is surrounded by a divine light, while the solemn expressions on the other apostles' faces show their intense devotion. This is a powerful and emotive painting, ideal to use as a background to a religious ceremony.  There are many possible interpretations of paintings, as the artist's intent is never fully crystal clear.  This painting could be interpreted as a representation of Christianity, with Thomas as the messenger of God, and St Louis as the protector.
