The painting features a couple sitting in a park, with a setting sun behind them. The man is looking off into the distance, and seems to be thinking about something. The woman is sitting next to him, and is looking down at him with a thought. She is wearing a pretty dress, and the man seems to be in a sunbeam because he is staring at the scenery around him intensely. This is a very beautiful painting, and it would be perfect for a home that wants to feel inspired and happy.  There are many possible interpretations of paintings, as the artist has left plenty to the imagination.
