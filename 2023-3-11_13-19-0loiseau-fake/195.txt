The painting is mostly composed of shades of blue, with an orange greek column in the center. The viewer is drawn towards the column and then up towards the sky, with a few clouds and stars peeking through. The orange may represent the fiery feelings present in the characters of the story, as Verona is a city famous for its festivals. The blue may also be representing the sky itself, which is ablaze with sunlight. The peacefulness of the scene is contrasted by the imposing, majestic presence of the building on the right. It could be interpreted that Verona is a symbol of civilization, but it also could be interpreted as a symbol of the city itself, which is struggling to maintain its place in the world.
