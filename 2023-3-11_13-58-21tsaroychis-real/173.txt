This painting is of a middle-aged man, Monsieur Lepoutre. Judging by the lines in his face and the wrinkles around his eyes, it appears that he has been through a lot in his life. He is dressed in a expensive suit, and his gaze isdominated by sadness. It is possible to see in hisexpression a longing for something that he cannot name or understand. The background of the painting is filled with shadowy figures, which may suggest that Monsieur Lepoutre is looking out at a life that is notquite what he wants it to be. The subtleism in the painting, with just a few scattered strokes of color, makes the figure stand out even more.
