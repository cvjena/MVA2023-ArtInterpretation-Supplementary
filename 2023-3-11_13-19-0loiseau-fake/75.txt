The painting is a view of the Himalayas from the Tibetan side, looking across the gorge known as the "Devil's Throat" to the mountains in the distance. Against a deep blue sky, the snowy peaks are sharply etched, their tips fading into the inky clouds. The painting may have been inspired by a trip Roerich made to the Himalayas in the early 1920s. Some historians believe that he painted this picture during one of his many travels, while others say that he captured the awe-inspiring beauty of the Himalayas in just a few short strokes.
