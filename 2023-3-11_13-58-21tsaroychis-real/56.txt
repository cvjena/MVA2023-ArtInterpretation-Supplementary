The painting captures the essence of France's colonial past, with the women dressed in extravagant costumes and the ship reflecting the flames of war. The women are dressed in traditional French costumes, in stark contrast to the bright colors of the ship. The sensual and emotive brushstrokes give the impression of movement and motion, as if the women are standing on the edge of the ship, caught in the moment. The painting could be interpreted as a commentary on the power of femininity and the danger of war. Alternatively, it could be seen as a depiction of French seafaring culture, with the ship representing the way in which women were starting to explore France's possibilities.
