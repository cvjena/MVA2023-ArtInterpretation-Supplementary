This sculpture is made up of a large block of granite with a small offshoot in the middle. The granite is rough and uneven, and there are deep trenches carved into it. Around the edge of the offshoot is a border of human bones, decaying naturally. The sculpture is large, and its implications are weighty. It could represent birth, life, death, and the cycle of rebirth. It is possible to read it as a monument to the power of the human skeleton, which despite its fragility, is infinitely strong.   The sculpture could be read as a commentary on the power of the human body, or even on the infinite potential for beauty.
