The man in the painting has a severe, angular appearance with sunken eyes and downturned mouth. The prominent Jaw and nose half-mask may be a reference to 19th century Russian piercings. He is wearing a sumptuous tuxedo and may be holding a spindle in his left hand, possibly representing his profession as a coat-hanger. The woman at his side may be a representation of his wife or mistress. This influential and dynamic couple may have had a turbulent relationship. Pissarro often painted portraits of powerful women, but this particular subject has a different emotional tone. The brightly colored dress and jeweled collar may represent the status and luxury of the man.
