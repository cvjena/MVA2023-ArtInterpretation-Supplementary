In this painting, the viewer can see the light reflecting off of the ocean and the vibrant colors of the sunset. The sky is a deep red, orange, and yellow and the sun is low in the sky, casting a warm glow over the sea. The waves are crashing onto the shore and the sand is brightly white. The painting is crowded with people and various buildings, but it is still cohesive and elegant. This painting reflects the feeling of joy and happiness that can come from spending time at the beach. It could be interpreted as a celebration of life and the beauty of nature. The painting is cheerful and optimistic, a stark contrast to the tumult of the world outside.
