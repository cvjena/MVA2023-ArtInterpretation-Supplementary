This self-portrait is likely a reflection of the artist's changing self- perception over time. He begins the portrait with a solemn and focused gaze, but by the end, his gaze has softened, and he appears more relaxed and at ease with himself. He may have painted the portrait shortly after completing a series of works exploring the theme of the human condition in relation to history. In this piece, the artist displays the various stages of his own development, from unrestrained naturalism in the earlier sections to a more fluid and expressive style in the later sections.  One possible interpretation of the painting could be that it is a portrayal of the artist's gradual transition from adolescence to adulthood, or from one self-portrait to another.
