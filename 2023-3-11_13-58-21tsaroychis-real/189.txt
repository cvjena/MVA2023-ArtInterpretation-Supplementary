Levitzky portrayed his subject as a vividly animated and ambitious revolutionary figure, full of characteristic gestures and expressions. P. V. Bakunin was a 19th century Russian anarchist philosopher, political theorist, writer, revolutionary and one of the founders of anarchist communism. He is also considered one of the most influential thinkers of the Russian revolutionary era. In this portrait, Levitzky captures the energy and intensity of Bakunin's stare, his bright eyes and strong features. The forge in the background symbolizes the effort Bakunin put into his work, while the banners and flags in the foreground depict his political ideals. The intense light and shadow give the painting a vibrancy and life.
