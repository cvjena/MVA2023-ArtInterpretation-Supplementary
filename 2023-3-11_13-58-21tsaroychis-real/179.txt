The subject is shown in one of several official portraits commissioned by Lutherâ€™s father, the Regent of the Mark. The officialdom, dignity and precision of the pose are accentuated by the elaborate background and the use of perspective, which gives depth and directional emphasis to the figure. Beneath the severe looking face, there is a hint of warmth and kindness, possibly stemming from the paternal relationship. The painting may also symbolize the regime change that Luther was bringing about; new order, new obligations. The artist captures all of this detail with powerful, dynamic brushstrokes. The background is filled with rich, deep blues and greens, giving the impression of depth and weight.
