The painting is set in a biblical scene and depicts the biblical story of Moses. Moses is seen in the middle of a army of angels that are gathering around him. To the left of Moses is an older gentleman in a military uniform, with a boy by his side, and next to him is an old man, both of whom are carrying instruments of war. In the background can be seen the mountain and the shore of the Israelites' Valley, as well as the Red Sea. The colors in the painting are very muted, with shades of blue, green, and brown predominating. This may be due to the fact that the angels are wearing somber clothing at the time, and the scene is set in a calm sea.
