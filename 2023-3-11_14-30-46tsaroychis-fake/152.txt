The painting is composed of a vast, mostly monochrome field with a few scattered bright spots, either white objects or areas of light. It could symbolize the emptiness and despair that befell the Third Reich after World War II. The artist stares off into the distance, lost in thought. The country side is partially visible, hinting at the turmoil and violence that was going on in Europe at the time. There is a sense of stillness and introspection here, as though the artist is exploring the complex and overwhelming emotions that can be associated with war. It could also be interpreted as a portrayal of the overwhelming loneliness and despair that the artist may have been experiencing at the time.
