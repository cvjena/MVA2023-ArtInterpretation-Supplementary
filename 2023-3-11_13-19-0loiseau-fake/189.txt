The painting depicts a stormy night with big waves crashing against the shore. The deep blue ocean and dark clouds look ominous, as if they could surge in any moment and swamp the coastline. High winds are whipping through the trees and the waves seem to be growing higher and higher. The scene is static, with no detail or colourpainted in for emphasis, providing a sense of maximum drama and intensity. The painting could be interpreted as an image of a turbulent and dangerous time in history, when dangerous conditions were taking place. The high drama and intensity of the painting could be adding to the tense feeling of the moment. It could also be seen as a metaphor for the artist's own turbulent personal life.
