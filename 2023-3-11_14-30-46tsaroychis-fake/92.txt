This painting depicts a herd of pigs frolicking in a beautiful pasture. The pigs are brightly painted with a variety of colors, and their fur is a deep brown. The scenery behind the pigs is softly sketched in black, with a white beard and tail. This peaceful and idyllic scene is contrasted by the hint of a dark figure lurking in the background, hinting at the dangers lurking just beyond the reach of the pigs.   A possible interpretation of this painting could be that it represents the farmer's view of the countryside, which was often very choppy and often hog-ridden. The painting may also be a commentary on the changing seasons, as the pigs in the field seem to be starting to decay.
