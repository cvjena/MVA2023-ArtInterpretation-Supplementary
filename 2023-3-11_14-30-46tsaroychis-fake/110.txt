The horizon is composed of a series of long, low hills extending to the distant skyline. These gradually incline towards one another and are gradually lit by the gradual onset of dawn. A narrow path leads diagonally from the lower left towards the middle of the painting, cutting diagonally across the composition. This path is lined with a series of slender trees, a detail which helps to create the sense of isolation and loneliness that often pervades depictions of the early morning. The predominant color is a warm and rich gray, which is offset by the white of the snow and the pale blue of the sky. The somber feel of the painting is offset by the bright light streaming in from the distant horizon.
