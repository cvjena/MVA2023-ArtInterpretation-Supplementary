This painting portrays a story of a beautiful young woman who is about to die. She is lying on a bed in a room and looks up at the sky, which is filled with Auroras (the northern and southern lights). Her body is well-defined and appears to be appear to be covered in a glow. The background looks like it is made up of multicolored clouds, and the door and windows behind her are both closed. This could be a representation of her hope for the future, as she is about to be protected by her loved ones. The painting is calm and peaceful, and seems to tell a story about the beauty of life.
