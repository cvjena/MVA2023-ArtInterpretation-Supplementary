The painting is a holy drama with a rich textured background. Saint Matthew, in a blue tunic and red cape, is holding an elaborate book in one hand and pointing with the other at the figure of Jesus. The background includes an angel with a chalice, a patriarchal couple, and a group of wealthy men. This painting is a powerful statement of the authority of the Church and its teachings. The religious figure Saint Jesus is surrounded by symbols of authority, including a cross, a book, and a ruler with a staff. This figure is a powerful reminder of the divine authority of the Church. The woman with the cat is a symbol of innocence and purity, as well as a symbol of the Virgin Mary.
