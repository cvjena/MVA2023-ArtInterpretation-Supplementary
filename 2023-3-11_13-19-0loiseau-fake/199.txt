The painting is dominated by a single large white flower with a vibrant green stem and leaves. The flowers are freshly cut and look very realistic, with tiny veins and petals shimmering in the light.. The background is a deep blue, and there is barely any other visible detail. This still life could represent the tranquility of the natural world, and the beauty of life's simple pleasures. The flowers could also be a symbol of the protectiveness of the individual, as they can be easily broken or lost. The deep blue background could be a reflection of the artist's own feelings, as he often dramatized the sorrow of life. The still life could be interpreted as a symbol of the resilience of the human spirit, despite hardships.
