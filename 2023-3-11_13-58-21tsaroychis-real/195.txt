The painting is of a man in a Renaissance-style robe, with a severe profile, sitting in a high-backed chair. He has a scribe's quill in his hand, and his eyes are closed, seeming to be in deep thought. He may represent the physician as a healer of the body, or as the keeper of the medical arts, or simply as a dignified figure. The painting may have been made to commemorate Dr. Chambers' services to Henry VIII, or to commemorate a medical treatise that he wrote.  There are many possible interpretations of paintings, and the ones given here are just examples. If you're unsure of what you'd like the painting to communicate, ask a art historian for help.
