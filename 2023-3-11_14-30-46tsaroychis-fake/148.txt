This painting depicts a snowy landscape with a lone tree standing out ethereally in the distance. The sky is a deep, dark blue, and the snow is a beautiful white. Trees and other objects nearby are barely visible, dappled only in the lightest patches of snow. The landscape is peaceful and serene, and seems to invite visitors inside to take a look at the beauty of nature in all her winter glory.  There is no one definitive interpretation of a painting, as the artist may change or add a new work in the background depending on the personal preferences of the viewer.
