The portrait is of a middle-aged man with a severe expression. He has a long, drawn-up face, with a thin, high-domed nose and deep-set eyes that seem to convey a great deal of anger or despair. He is depicted wearing a full-length robe with a high-necked collar, and his long, brown hair is pulled back into a low tail. Hans Melber was an important citizen of Nuremberg, and the portrait may have been commissioned to celebrate his political career or his wealth. It is possible that the artist chose to depict him in this way to emphasize the severity of his character.
