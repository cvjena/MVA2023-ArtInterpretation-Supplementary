This painting portrays an infant Jesus Christ being lowered into Christ’s tomb by two angels. The Virgin is shown looking downwards at the child with loving devotion. She is flanked on either side by Saint Bernard and Saint Clare, both of whom are looking down at the infant with adoration. The saints’ robes are elegant and their hair is parted in the middle, a sign of their spiritual authority. This painting is a testament to the power of prayer and the faith of the people. It is a dark and solemn depiction of a religious moment. The use of light and shadow gives the painting a sense of depth and weight. The people in the painting appear to be praying and nursing because of the infant’s death.
