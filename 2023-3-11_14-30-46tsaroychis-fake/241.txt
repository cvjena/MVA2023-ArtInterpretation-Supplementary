This painting features the Virgin Mary, accompanied by Saint Elizabeth and Saint John the Baptist, standing in front of a large panel. Mary is holding the infant Jesus, while Saint Elizabeth and Saint John hold out gifts. The painting is set against a golden background, and is believed to have been painted for the domus of Arezzo.       A possible interpretation of "The Visitation" by Domenico Ghirlandaio could be that it is a religious painting, depicting the scene of the Virgin Mary visiting Saint Elizabeth and Saint John the Baptist. The background could represent heaven, and the saints could be representing the Guardian Angels. The golden background could represent the paradise that is depicted in the Bible.
