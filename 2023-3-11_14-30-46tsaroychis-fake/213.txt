The painting is mostly dominated by a deep blue sky, with some wispy clouds and a white snow-capped peak in the distance. The blue is a very intense color and dominates the painting, with the other colors being used to add detail or emphasis. In the foreground, there is a man walking, and in the background there are rocks and a tree. This may represent the artist's view of life, with mankind striving to reach the peak, and the juxtaposition of the natural and the artificial, as well as the physical and the spiritual. The white snow-capped peak in the distance may also symbolize the spiritual life the artist is striving, and the shining sun in the background may represent his hope for a better future.
