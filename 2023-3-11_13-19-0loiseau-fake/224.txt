This painting is a portrait of a young woman with delicate features and long, chestnut curls. The painter seems to be concentrating on the woman's eyes, which are gazing Off To The Distance With A Soaring Sense Of Appetite. The bright red lips, the stark white skin, and the striking black dress are all working together to create an intense and powerful image. The Head of Boyarynya Morozova may represent the artist's own feelings of power and sexuality, which are both captivating and dangerous. This painting may be a meditation on the power of love, and the ability of humans to overcome challenges.
