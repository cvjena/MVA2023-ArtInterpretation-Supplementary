This painting is a powerful and confrontational depiction of Jesus Christ. His features are harsh and uncompromising, as if he is about to deliver a blow to the viewer. The contours of his body are distorted and massive, with a muscular torso and large, penetrating eyes. His robes billow around him menacingly, as if he is about to thunder down on his enemies. The setting is dark and brooding, with a stormy sky and angry, flashing lightning. This is a painting that speaks of turmoil and conflict, of a religious figure who is also powerful and imposing. This painting could be seen as a symbol of the strength and defiance of Jesus Christ, and the power of compassion that he holds.
