This painting is a dramatic and powerful depiction of a stormy night. The dark, ominous clouds seem to be rolling in, and the rain is pouring down. The foreground is cluttered with overturned cars and tents, and a man can be seen trying to make a way through the chaos. The composition is intricate, with intricate details in the landscape and in the characters' faces. It is a complex and powerful painting, and could be interpreted as a representation of the German people's emotional response to the horrors of World War II. It could also be seen as a warning of the dangers of war. The stormy night could be a metaphor for the turmoil and destruction that was happening at the time.
