This painting is a formal portrait, and depicts a man in a dignified pose with a contemplative expression. He may be a clergyman or brother of the abbot, and the clothing and setting indicate that he would have been of c urial rank. The ornate and sophisticated clothing, the air of confidence, and the finely detailed paintwork all contribute to the impression of nobility. The man's face is smooth and ageless, and the subtle eyes convey a sense of deep thought. The painting could be interpreted as a self-portrait, showing the artist at his most pious and contemplative.
