The woman is sitting, with her back to the viewer, facing a mirror with a canvas at her feet. She is wearing a tailored dress and her hair is pulled back into a bun. The painting is dominated by the woman's reflection, which is shown in broad daylight and captures her radiant features. She appears to be gazing at the viewer, with a serene and peaceful expression. Her clothing and the background are both brightly illuminated, giving the impression of a sun-drenched world.   The painting is a classic example of the Impressionist style, which sought to capture the true beauty of everyday objects. It uses delicate light and shadow to create a stunning effect, and the woman's features are barely visible.
