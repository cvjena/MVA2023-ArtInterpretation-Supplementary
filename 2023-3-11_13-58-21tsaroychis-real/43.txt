The stark lighting and subdued colors emphasize the severity of the setting, which could be a reflection of the difficult period of political and social upheaval in Russia at that time. He might be posing for the picture as an act of protest or as a way to communicate his feelings about the current state of affairs. The bold use of color is intended to represent the vitality and vibrancy of Russia at that time. The artist may have been portraying himself as an important figure in society. This could be seen as a statement of defiance against the harshness of the world around him.
