This painting is a dense, dark forest filled with swampy areas. Trees and undergrowth are densely packed together, and the only light comes from the few stars visible in the sky. The painting may be inspired by natural disasters and the chaos and destruction they can cause, as well as the natural mysticism of the wilderness. The swamp may represent the natural environment that is being disrupted by man, or the natural chaos and destruction that man can bring. The blue in the painting may represent the sky, which is being darkened by the darkness of the night. This could symbolize the hope that is being lost in the world, as well as the resilience of the human spirit.
