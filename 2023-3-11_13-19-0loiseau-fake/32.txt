The painting is set in a dense forest with tall trees reaching up to the sky. Niches in the trees contain various types of animals, and the river can be seen winding its way through the forest. Early morning light streams in through the trees, creating a beautiful, ethereal atmosphere. The forest may represent Russia's forests, which were very dense and full of life. This painting may be a reminder of the power of nature, and the beauty of life that can be enjoyed only in the present moment.
