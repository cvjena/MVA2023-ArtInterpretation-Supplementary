This painting is a depiction of the Virgin Mary as the Queen of Heaven, wearing a lavender dress and crowned with a halo. She is surrounded by angels and has her hand raised in a blessing. Behind her is a majestic grey palace with a golden statue of the goddess Minerva in the entrance. This is a scene from the apocryphal Book of Assumption which tells of how the Virgin Mary ascended into Heaven after she was buried in the tomb of St. Peter. Some believe that the painting actually depicts the moment when Mary was shown into the afterlife after her crucifixion. Others believe that it may also depict the moment when Mary was shown into heaven after her father's death.
