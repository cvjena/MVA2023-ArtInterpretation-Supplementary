This painting portrays the moment when the angel Gabriel announced to the Virgin Mary that she was to bear the Son of God. The young and idealistic Virgin is seated in a graceful pose with her hands resting on her knees. She is surrounded by a lavish and brightly lit interior, representing the Angelic realm. Behind her is the curtained off area representing the womb in which the child will be conceived. Above and behind the Virgin, an angel heralds the news to the anxious mother. The Divine light bathing the whole scene is a reminder that this is a miraculous moment, brought about by the will of God.
