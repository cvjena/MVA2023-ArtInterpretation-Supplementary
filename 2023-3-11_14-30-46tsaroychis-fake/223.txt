This sculpture is of a nude woman from the waist up. She has sleek, flowing hair that covers one shoulder and extends down both arms. Her head is tilted slightly to the side, and her eyes are closed with an almost pensive look. Bronze radiates warmth from her figure and she has a delicate, almost fragile, look about her. It is possible to Interpret this sculpture as a metaphor for the female body and its power to create. She is creating something that is both beautiful and powerful. Her aura of protection and strength is conveying in this way. The sculpture may also be seen as a reference to the traditional feminine body and the feminine mind.
