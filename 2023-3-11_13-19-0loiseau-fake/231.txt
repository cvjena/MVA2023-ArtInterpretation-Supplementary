This painting portrays a woman in profile, looking at herself in a mirror. She may be admiring her appearance, or contemplating what she will wear for the day. The light shining into the room from the window filters through the gauzy curtains and casts a warm and inviting glow on the figure. The ornate toile duvet and chair give the room a touch of luxury. The woman's clothing may suggest that she is from a more rural background, perhaps France. The painting is reminiscent of Impressionist paintings of rural life, but this is a more modern, more idealized style. The light shining into the room from the window might symbolize the warmth and security of the home.
