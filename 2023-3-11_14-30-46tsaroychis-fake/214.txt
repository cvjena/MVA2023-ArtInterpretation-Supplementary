This painting is of a rocky landscape in the desert. The dark, weathered rocks are sharply contrasting against the bright blue sky and sand. High up in the sky, there are several white, fluffy clouds. The painting seems to suggest a sense of loneliness and isolation. The mountaintop is a dominating feature in the scene, and it is surrounded by a dense, mountainous range. The painting might represent the artist's feelings of isolation and self-doubt in his life. The artist might have been portraying the desert environment as a representation of his home country. The white clouds in the sky represent the purity of his heart, while the blue sky gives the impression of the calmness and serenity of the desert.
