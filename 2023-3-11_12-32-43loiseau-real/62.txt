This painting is a portrait of three women with red tongues. The women are looking at each other with visceral expressions, with their eyes wide open and their eyebrows hanging up in terror. The painting was created in the early 1900s, during the Belle Ã‰poque, and the women are a symbol of the Podemos phenomenon, which was when the number of people in the French Riviera rose from a single figure to represent the whole of France. The painting has a hot, bright red color, and it is possible to see the women's expressions in the center of the painting. It is possible to read the women as being in a state of terror and anger, and the bright red color as representing the intensity of their anger.
