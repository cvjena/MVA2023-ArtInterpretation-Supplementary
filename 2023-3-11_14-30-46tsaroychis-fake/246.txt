This painting portrays the Madonna and Child as the protectors of the Catholic Church. Saint Peter Martyr, also known as Simon Magus, is seen as a saint who helped spread Christianity in the early centuries. He is often depicted with a sword in one hand and a book in the other. He is shown kneeling behind the Madonna and Child, providing spiritual protection. Lorenzo Lotto portrayed the scene with great attention to detail, including the placement of the flies on the wall and the gold pattern on the Madonna's cloak. The whole painting is a testament to the power of the Catholic Church and its ability to protect the Church from harm.
