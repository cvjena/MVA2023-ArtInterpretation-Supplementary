This portrait is of a distinguished-looking, sophisticated man. He might have been a poet or a literary critic, judging by the reading glasses perched on his nose and the book in his hand. He looks fondly at the subject of the portrait, a young woman with straight, blonde hair pulled back into a bun. The woman's dignified pose and attractive features may have been the highlights of Corinth's portraiture, as he was known for his realistic portraits. The artist used a range of cool, blues, pinks, and greens to create a peaceful and serene atmosphere, underscored by the subtle light effects in the background. This painting could symbolize the man's eternal love and admiration for nature.
