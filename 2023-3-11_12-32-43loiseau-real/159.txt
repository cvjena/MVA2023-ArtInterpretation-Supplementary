In this painting, the artist captures the personality and beauty of his sitter with skillful brushstrokes. The woman is depicted as if being illuminated by a softly glowing light and her features are delicate yet refined. Her long, pale hair is styled in a beautiful bun and her eyes seem to express intelligence and insight. Mrs Martin is evidently a very wealthy woman, judging by the luxurious attire she is wearing. It is possible to imagine her receiving a royal appointment or being at the heart of some important political affair. The painting could also be interpreted as a portrait of the sitter's friend or family. Mrs Martin might be a symbol of strength and stability, while the sitter is representative of the upper class who are struggling to make ends meet.
