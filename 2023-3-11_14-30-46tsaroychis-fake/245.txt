This painting depicts the Madonna, holding infant Jesus and an infant St. Jerome, being attended to by St. Anthony of Padua, circa 1521. This religious artwork is an uplifting example of the Renaissance era's ideal of piety and charity. The Madonna is shown in a serene pose, with her hand raised in a blessing gesture, and her eyes cast towards heaven. The saints personify the virtues that the Catholic Church prioritizes: faith, hope, and charity. This image conveys the idea that through devotion to these three virtues, we can achieve salvation. The richly detailed background and costumes give this painting a sense of realism.
