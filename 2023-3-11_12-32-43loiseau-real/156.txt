This painting is thought to depict a scene from the life of a Buddhist monk. The monk is begging for forgiveness from a deity, most likely for some sin he has committed. The deity is portrayed as a wrathful and powerful figure, with large eyebrows and fierce looking eyes. The monk is kneeling on the ground, with both hands outstretched, showing his humility and lack of confidence. Behind the monk, there is a landscape, with trees and hills in the distance. It is possible to read the painting as a representation of the monk's journey towards enlightenment, or as a warning to readers about the dangers of fully giving into anger and rage.
