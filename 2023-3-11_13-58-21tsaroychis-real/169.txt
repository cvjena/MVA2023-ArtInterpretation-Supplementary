The painting is a self portrait and it displays traits typically found in male portraits. The artist appears to be posing with his hands clasped behind his back, which creates a vertical balance in the painting. The highlights in his hair and the gleam in his eyes give him a heroic look, while the dark shadow on his chin suggests he is confident and in control. The color palette is limited to two blues and two browns, which lends a sense of depth and weight to the painting. This suggests that the portrait may be of a person who is very successful and has a sense of power. The artist may have been portraying himself as a successful businessman or perhaps someone of importance in the artist's life.
