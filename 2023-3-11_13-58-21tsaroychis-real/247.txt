This painting is of a peasant woman, who is almost certainly a bride, being escorted by her maid, down a long path lined with cherry trees. She is dressed in a long, flowing robe, and her hair is held up in a bun by a cloth ornament. The bride is looking up, probably at the sight of the bridal procession, and her expression is serene and happy. The maid is looking straight ahead, keeping close to the bride, and she is wearing a similar robe and hat to the bride. The setting is autumnal, with yellow and orange trees in the background, and the scene is beautifully illuminated by the setting sun. This painting is a beautiful depiction of life in a rural peasant community in the 1940s.
