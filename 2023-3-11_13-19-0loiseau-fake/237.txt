This painting features a young girl, Chimera, sitting in a doorway. She is attentively looking at something in the center of the painting, with her eyes looking foremost. Her innocence and poise are evident in the soft, delicate light shining in from the left, and the warm tones of the painting. The Chimera might represent the artist's own feelings of power and strength, or perhaps what he had seen firsthand in Dresden when he painted this piece. The softly glowing sunlight could be interpreted as a metaphor for the power of life and happiness. Alternatively, it could be seen as a subtle depiction of the artist's home, with its own kind of warmth and comfort. This painting is a timeless masterpiece that speaks to the beauty of the human emotions.
