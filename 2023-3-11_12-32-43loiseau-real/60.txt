This painting is a very detailed and lifelike portrait of a man. His facial features are twisted in a way that suggests that he is in pain, or angry. His eyes appear to be filled with unshed tears, and his mouth is set in a hard line, indicating that he is stern and unapproachable. He is wearing a luxurious robe, and his dark hair is curly and Augustine-like. This painting may be a portrayal of Bindo Altoviti, a magnate in the Republic of Florence during the Renaissance. He was also a very powerful figure in Greek and Roman history. This painting could be a depiction of his many accomplishments, or it could be a representation of his personality and position.
