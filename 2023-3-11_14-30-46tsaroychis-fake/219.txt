This painting features a young man, probably in his early to mid twenties, sitting at a desk with a book in his hand. He is staring off into the distance, lost in thought, and the shadows on his face and clothing create a deep and textured effect. Based on the pose and the clothing, it's possible that this could be a portrait of a wealthy gentleman. Eakins was known for his realism and ability to capture the character of his subjects. This painting could represent Eakins' dedication to his own life and his love of learning.
