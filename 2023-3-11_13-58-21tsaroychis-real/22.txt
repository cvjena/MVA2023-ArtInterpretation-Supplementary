This painting is a documentation of Paula Modersohn Becker's own aging process. The worn features, wrinkles, and gray hair give testament to the experience of time. The traditional painting medium of oil allows the artist to capture the telltale signs of age, while also capturing the spirit and beauty of the sitter. This painting could be interpreted as a depiction of the process of aging, or of the journey of life. The stark simplicity of the composition and muted colors could suggest that this is a process in which the details of the world are slowly fading away. The artist may have been portraying this journey as a way of life's journey, with all its potential for change.
