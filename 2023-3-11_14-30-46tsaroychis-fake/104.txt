Luminosity fills the canvas like a palpable force, flooding everything in its path with life. In the foreground at the left, a tree stands proud, its leaves rustling in the wind. Nearby, a small building comes into view, and beyond that, a long field stretches out to the horizon. The sky is a deep blue and heavily charged with electricity, creating an imposing and powerful atmosphere. In the mid-ground, a lone, gently-flowing stream divides the land in two, and on the other side, lush fields of crops can be seen.   The painting could be interpreted as a tribute to the power and beauty of nature.
