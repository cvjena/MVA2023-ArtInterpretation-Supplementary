She's wearing a dress that falls just below her knees, and her expression is serene and contemplative. She might be holding a bouquet of fresh flowers, or she could be looking at something that's very important to her. This painting is strikingly beautiful, and it would be a wonderful addition to any home.  There are many interpretations that could be given for a painting, depending on the viewer's preferences.
