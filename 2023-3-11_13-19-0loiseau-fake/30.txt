This painting features a solitary figure walking through a woodland setting. The trees are a blurred, indistinct mass, and the leaves on the trees are small and closed. The light is coming from the left, shining through the trees and illuminating the walkway ahead of the man. The man is wearing a long, billowing tunic, and he is carrying a walking stick. He might be thinking about the beauty of the forest, or he might be wondering where he is going. The leaves in the trees are a soft, green color, and the sky is a deep blue. This painting is a peaceful, serene image. It could be a portrait of the artist himself, or it could be a depiction of a scene from nature.
