The painting features a wide open, hilly landscape with a few small houses in the distance. There is a strong Neyllanic feel to the painting with its soft, muted colors and pastoral setting. The artist may have been inspired by the great natural scenery of his Southern homeland. The title could also be interpreted as referencing the Old Testament Garden of Eden, where Jesus was crucified. The hauntingly beautiful rural scene could depict the idyllic peace and tranquility of this special place. The painting may also symbolize the artist's love for the rural countryside and the peace and serenity that can be found there.
