The age-old question of what it is to be a human being is captured in this self-portrait. We see Parmigianino's deeply spiritual and introspective side, as well as his vulnerability. He seems to be contemplating how he measures up to the high expectations of others, and whether he lives up to his own standard. It is a portrayal of great dignity, underpinned by inner courage.  A possible interpretation of this painting could be that it captures the deep spiritual side of Parmigianino, who was a great artist. The brilliant colors and reflective surface of the painting could represent the depth of his feelings, and the reflection could be seen as a portrayal of his introspective state.
