The painting is of a young girl playing with a bird. She is sitting on the ground with her back against the bird, studying it intently. The bird is a beautiful turquoise color, and the girl seems to be looking at it with a very positive outlook. She is very beautiful and peaceful, and the painting is a beautiful example of early 20th century Russian art. There is a sense of nostalgia in the painting, and it could be interpreted as a reflection of the girl's life. The blue color in the painting could represent the girl's connection to the sky and the heavens, and the peacefulness of the painting could be seen as a representation of the girl's childhood.
