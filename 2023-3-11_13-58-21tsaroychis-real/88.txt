This painting features a pastoral vista, with a wide, open field and a gently-rising hill in the distance. The intense blue and yellow hues of the sky and the deep green of the trees create a tranquil and peaceful atmosphere. The bleakness of the landscape is offset by the softening light and the gentle curve of the path leading up to the hill. The distance makes the skyline look as if it's standing on the edge of a mountain range. This painting is a reminder of the natural beauty and peace of rural life. It could also be interpreted as a symbol of hope, as the bright and optimistic colors reflect the optimistic outlook of the times.
