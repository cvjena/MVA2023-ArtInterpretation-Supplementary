This painting features a pastoral landscape with a calm river meandering its way through the center of the picture. The greenery and blue sky are beautiful together, and the painting could be interpreted as a representation of the serenity and peace that the artist found in this landscape. The serenity could also be seen as a reflection of the artist's own feelings at the time, as he was slowly recovering from a personal medical condition. The wide range of colors used in this painting could also be seen as a representation of the wide range of emotions that the artist was feeling at the time.
