This painting may depict the scene from a gothic opera in which the protagonist, Count Orlofsky, has been captured by the Pechenegs. The Pechenegs are a tribe of nomadic warriors who live in the steppes of Eastern Europe. They use a fearsome Attila-style warfarehorse, which is pictured menacingly in the painting. The costumes, which are brightly colored and elaborate, may represent the wealth and power of the Pechenegs. The details in the costumes may also symbolize aspects of the opera, such as the battle scene depicted in the background. One example is the ornate armor and weapons of the Pechenegs.
