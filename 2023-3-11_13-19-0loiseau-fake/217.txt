In this painting, the artist seems to be looking inward at his own soul, examining the emotions and thoughts that lie within. He has deliberately chosen to paint himself in a relaxed pose, with his head lowered and his eyes closed. He appears to be calm and in control, which is testament to his honed skills as a musician. The soft blue and purple tones in the painting create a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere, which could be seen as a personal statement about the artist's own journey towards inner peace.  There are many, many possible interpretations of paintings, as the artist's intent is never fully clear. A skilled art historian can help you to understand what the artist is feeling, and what emotions he is feeling about it.
