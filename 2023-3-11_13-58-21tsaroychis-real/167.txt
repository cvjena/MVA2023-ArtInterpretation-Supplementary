This painting is a portrait of a man who is presumably a philosopher. He has a distinguished looking face and is looking intently at the viewer. He has a long, wavy, gray mustache that extends down below his upper lip. There is a build up of emotion in his eyes, as if he is thinking deeply about something. This painting is a very timeless portrait, and could be interpreted in a variety of ways. It could be interpreted as a portrait of a man who is famous for his philosophical work, or it could simply be an intuition of the artist portraying a man she knows well. It could also be interpreted as a portrait of a man she is romanticized of, judging by the furrowed brow and thoughtful expression.
