This painting is a religious scene, inspired by the story of Moses. Moses is seen atop of a hill, towards the right, with the Israelites in the distance below him. He is shaking a staff in front of his face, and his hands are crossed in a sign of blessing. God is seen in the sky, with the sun behind him and a halo around his head. Reni's attention to detail is apparent in the folds in Moses' robe, the cow bells on the Israelites' robes, and the mists in the background. This painting is a beautiful example of classical art, and it is a beautiful work of art.
