Rainer Maria Rilke is sitting directly in front of the viewer, with his head slightly to the right, looking off to the side. He has a gentle, serene expression on his face, and his eyes seem to be gazing inward. He is wearing a stylish, cosmopolitan outfit, with a striped shirt and ankle-length pants. This painting probably represents Rilke's aspiration to be admired and respected by worldly-wise intellectuals and artists. Additionally, the bright colors and light in the background could be interpreted as a sign of happiness and enlightenment. This is an artist who is known for his vibrant and colorful paintings, and this particular color could represent joy and happiness.
