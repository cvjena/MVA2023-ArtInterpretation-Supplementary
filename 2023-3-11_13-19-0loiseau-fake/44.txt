Savrasov was a Russian realist painter of the 19th century. This painting is of a Russian forest in the late 1800s. The trees areimbued with wind, mossy leaves and branches, and the trees are silhouetted against the inky sky. This impression of depth is due to the fact that the painting is not actually close to the viewer. Far away in the distance one can see the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas. This peaceful and serene scene could be interpreted as a metaphor for the beauty and tranquility of nature. The painting is an excellent example of the beauty of Russian landscape paintings. It captures the majesty and power of nature.
