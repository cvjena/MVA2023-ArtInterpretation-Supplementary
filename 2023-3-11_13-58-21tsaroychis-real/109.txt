This painting depicts the coastal city of Sevastopol, located in the Ukraine. The city is located on a peninsula and has a long history of being contested by various nations. The painting is filled with crowded buildings, ships at dock, and the iconic Christ the Conqueror statue. The colors are bright and vibrant, indicating the prosperity of the city. The painting may be inspired by the historical importance of the city to the peninsula, or it could be seen as a symbol of the Ukrainian struggle for independence. It could also be seen as a commentary on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which began in 1893 and ended with the breakup of the Soviet Union.
