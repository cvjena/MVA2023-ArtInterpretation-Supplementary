This painting is about the journey of life, in particular the journey of a small boat through turbulent water. It is a metaphor for life's adversity and journey. The boat has been battered by the waves and is listing to one side, which suggests that its journey is not going the way it wanted it to. The reds and oranges of the boat appear to be vibrating, as if they are giving off heat in the cold night air. The lights of the city reflect off the water, providing a level of illumination that gives the boat some relief from the darkness. The boat is floating on the surface of the water, which is a journey that is full of both serenity and danger.
