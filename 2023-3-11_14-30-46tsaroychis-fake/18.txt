This painting portrays a woman as she goes about her everyday routine of putting on her stockings. There is a sense of calm and order in the painting, as the woman proceeds with her task methodically. She is surrounded by familiar objects and seems to be in a comfortable and serene environment. The woman's concentration is reflected in the contours of her face, which are barely perceptible. The surrounding light gives the impression of a warm glow. This painting is a good example of Reinhardt's focus on composition and expression of emotion. He used light and shadow to create a sense of depth and space in the painting. This painting is a reminder of the magnitude of woman and her role in the world.
