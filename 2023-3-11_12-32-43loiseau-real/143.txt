It is possible to see the Holy Family depicted with Saint Francis, Saint Clare, and Saint John the Baptist, all kneeling in prayer around the infant Jesus. Saint Francis, the founder of the Franciscan movement, is looking squarely at the child, whereas Saint Clare and Saint John are looking down adoringly. Around the periphery of the painting are various biblical elements, including the 12 Apostles and an inscription reading "In principio erat verbum" (In the beginning was the word). The sophistication of the composition and the high quality of the brushwork make this one of Schongauer's most renowned religious paintings. It is possible to read this painting as a religious allegory emphasizing the power of faith and the connection between humanity and God.
