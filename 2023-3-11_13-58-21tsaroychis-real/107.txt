This painting captures a busy pier with boats docking and people going by. The bright colors and vista of the Mediterranean Sea can be seen in the foreground, as well as a few buildings in the distance. This painting might represent the artist's memories of his homeland, or it could be related to moments he's felt while walking around Mediterranean City. One possible interpretation is that the pier is a representation of the life and growth of the city itself. The colors and the sky are both bright and cheerful, indicating that the city is full of life and energy. The painting could also be symbolic of the way that the city has changed over time, and how it has changed over time.
