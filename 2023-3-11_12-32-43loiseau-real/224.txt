Kusama's Fields In Spring 1988 depicts a pastoral setting, sprawled out before you. Bright green fields and pinkish-white flowers dot the horizon, curving gently toward the sky. A warm light casts a mellow hue over everything, making the scene look serene and welcoming. In the foreground, a wooded area stretches out, appearing to lead right up to the field. This may be a representation of the natural world, which is ever-changing and ever-promising.  A possible interpretation of " Fields In Spring" could be that it is a depiction of the summertime, or of the hope for humanity of finding beauty and peace in the midst of all the chaos.
