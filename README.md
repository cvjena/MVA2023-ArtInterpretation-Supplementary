# ArtInterpretation-Supplementary
Contains supplementary material for our accepted submission to the MVA2023.
More specifically, it includes four directories each containing 250 generated images and interpretations respectively.
These are generated iteratively by alternating a latent diffusion model together with our best-performing interpretation model.
Each of these directories corresponds to one of the example images from the paper.
The relevant paragraph in the paper is:

> Furthermore, we examined alternating cycles of interpretation and art generation using the LDM specified above and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\mathcal{I}_{artif.}" />. We observe no convergence to one specific art style or subject. The interpretations often focus on specific image parts, which then feature more prominently in the next generated image. After a while, this seems to lead to a switch in focus, which is highly related to the art style itself.
