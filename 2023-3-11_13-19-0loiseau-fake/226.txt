This painting is of a young woman with long, curly hair. She is wearing a white blouse and a headscarf, and she is looking away from the viewer, with her eyes half closed. She appears to be in a state of deep concentration, and she appears to be perhaps in her own thoughts or feelings. The background is a light, slightly blurred sky, and the painting is dominated by the woman's features, which are delicate and graceful. This painting could be interpreted as a portrayal of a young woman who is lost in thought, and who is overwhelmed by the intensity of her feelings.
