This painting is composed of a field of wheat surrounded by a cluster of building in the distance. The wheat is a dark color, almost black, and the cluster of buildings is a light color, almost white. The background is a light blue color, almost a gray. The painting is peaceful and still, with only the sound of the wind and the rustling leaves in the trees heard in. This could be a representation of the artist's life, as he was a painter and working in a rural area. The buildings could represent the social order that he was trying to protect, and the wheat could represent the wealth he was trying to create. This could be a depiction of his hope for the future.
