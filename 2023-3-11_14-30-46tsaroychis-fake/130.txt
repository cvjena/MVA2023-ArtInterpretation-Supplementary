The tree in the foreground is the focus of the painting, with the rest of the landscape becoming less and less important as the viewer looks further into the painting. The splashing of the water in the background creates the illusion of movement, while the elegant stems and leaves of the trees give the impression of luxury. The muted colors give the painting a sense of calm and peace. The use of light and shadow gives the painting a sense of depth. The artist's use of perspective gives the painting a sense of height and balance. The painting seems to convey a sense of stability and strength. The tree could be a symbol of strength and life, while the water could be a symbol of life and fertility.
