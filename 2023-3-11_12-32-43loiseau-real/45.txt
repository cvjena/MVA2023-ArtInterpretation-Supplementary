This painting is a portrait of a woman who is probably tired and bored, her eyes are closed and she appears to be in a state of repose. She is wearing a simple, long dress and her hair is pulled back into a bun. This portrait is one of the earliest examples of French Realism, which is a style of painting that focuses on capturing the realistic details of everyday life. The artist was known for his meticulous depictions of everyday life and this painting seems to be a perfect example of that. The background is a blurred view of a room, possibly giving the impression of depth. The colors are muted, giving the painting a somber mood.
