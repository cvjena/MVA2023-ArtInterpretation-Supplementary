The painting is set in a city street, where a lone man is walking home with his back to the viewer. The buildings in the background are the focal point of the painting, with a neatly trimmed up hill in the foreground. The motion of the people and the cars in the street are portrayed with a refined precision, while the sun sets in the sky behind the man. This painting could be interpreted as a snapshot of a happy moment, or a depiction of the man's own anxiety. The muted colors give the painting a tired, loneliness-filled feeling. The man's motion may also suggest that he is away from home, perhaps away from the people and the city that he is living in.
