This portrait, composed of a series of carefully painted small heads, features headshots of young women with fiery, out-of-control hair. The use of red in the border cleverly recalls both our primal appetite for blood and our higher emotions. The artist could be commenting on the power of passion, but also perhaps the destructive potential of hormones. The model for this head seems to be in the early stages of transformation, hinting at the tumultuousness of life. Behind the women, we can see a haze of activity, as if they are getting ready for a storm. This painting is imbued with a deep sense of mystery and intrigue, making it an excellent addition to any art collection.
