In this painting, La Thangue demonstrates the power of perspective. Perspective is created when objects are placed at a finite distance from the viewer. In this particular painting, the road appears to curve inward, leading the viewer down to the banks of the river. The dark green trees along the roadside and the bright white buildings in the distance create a sense of depth. The painting also features a glimpse of the faraway hills, which adds to the impression of realism. The artist used a limited palette of colors to create a striking and powerful image.   There are many possible interpretations of this painting, but one possible interpretation could be that the road is a representation of the journey that the viewer is taking.
