This painting is a view of the River Epte near Argenteuil, France, taken in June of 1875. The clean white clouds upon the river contrast with the bright blue sky, giving the painting a celestial feeling. The curvaceous lines in the river and the reflections of the trees in the water give the painting a naturalistic feel. This may be a painting of a tranquil moment, or it could represent the peace and beauty of nature. Monet often painted scenes of rural life, capturing the feeling of immediacy and realism. This painting is a great example of his skill. It is possible to see the details of the clothing, the trees, and the landscape in the distance.
