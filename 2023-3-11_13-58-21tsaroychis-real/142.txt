The painting depicts a dense forest leading to a cliff edge. If you look closely, you can see the silhouettes of trees in the distance. The green forest is wonderfully evocative, and the bright blue sky is stunning. This could be interpreting the forest as a place of safety, comfort, and refuge, as well as a place of danger. The leaves of the trees rustle in the wind, and the light blue sky shines over the edge of the cliff.
