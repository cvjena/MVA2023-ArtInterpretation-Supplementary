The painting is a study of form and light. The heavy shadows reminiscent of Spanish colonial architecture create a sense of ponderous power while the pale, delicate colors invite the viewer inside the skin of the woman. Josephine is contemplative and her hair falls in gentle waves around her face. The painting is full of sensuality and quiet strength. It could be interpreted as a portrait of a powerful woman who is lost in thought. The artist used a technique called chiaroscuro, which involves contrasting colors to create a three-dimensional effect. The light shines down on Josephine's face, giving her an ethereal quality. She seems to be floating in space, free from the world.
