The woman in this painting appears to be in anguish, with her head bowed and her hands clasped tightly together in front of her. She is wearing a severe expression, and her features are starkly outlined against the dark background. This could be a comment on the turmoil of the times in which the painting was created, or it could be a portrait of a real person who was in a bad mood. The use of black and white allows for a more powerful and dramatic image, and the woman's anguish is starkly conveyed in the painting. This painting could be interpreted as a commentary on the political and social unrest of the time, or it could be seen as a portrait of a woman who is upset with someone.
