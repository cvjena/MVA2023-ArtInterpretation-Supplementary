This painting depicts a tranquil scene of the river Seine at Bougival in the Rouen region of France, in the early 1870s. The artist captures the shades of green in the riverbed and the trees along the banks, while the bright sunlight bathes the dew-covered grass and tilt of the rooftops. In the distance, you can see the outline of the medieval city of Rouen. Sisley often portrayed landscapes of the Normandy region, using light and color to evoke a feel of calm and peace. This painting is a perfect example of that. The seine is a beautiful symbol of beauty and tranquility, and the bright colors are a reminder of the peace and tranquility that can be found at the river.
