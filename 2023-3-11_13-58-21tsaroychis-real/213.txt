The painting is of a distinguished-looking man, with a sorrowful expression. He may represent experience or disillusionment, or both. The painting might be interpreted as a portrait of the artist's own soul, in which case it would reflect Konchalovsky's sense of alienation and longing. Alternatively, the subject could represent a model for the artist, someone he admired and looked up to. The background could represent the artist's studio, with all of the other objects representative of the various materials the artist had used. The artist might be portraying a moment of reflection or self-possession. Alternatively, the painting could simply be interpreted as a snapshot of a particular moment in the artist's life.
