Savrasov was one of the last of the Romantic landscape painters. This painting shows a road winding through the woods. Nearby are some overturned trees, and in the distance you can see the tops of the trees. In the center of the painting is a large tree stump. The painting has a peaceful feeling, and it might symbolize the journey the viewer is on. The landscape is very naturalistic, and it might depict a countryside that has been here for centuries. Savrasov might have been representing the tranquility of the forest as well as the austerity of nature. He also might have been representing the vastness of the forest. This painting is a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always hope.
