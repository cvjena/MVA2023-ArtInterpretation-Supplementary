This painting is a religious icon of the Immaculate Conception, the conception of the Virgin Mary after the Resurrection. The cherubim and the seraphim surround the Virgin, who is flanked by the Franciscanat brothers. The painting is a masterpiece of Baroque art, and it is typical of Tiepolo's use of light and shadow to create a dramatic effect. The painting may represent the importance of theception of Mary, or it may be a more specific religious event, such as the Annunciation. What is important is that the scene is conveyed with precision and in a realistic setting. Beardsley was a master of painting floral elements, and this particular painting is a great example of his skill.
