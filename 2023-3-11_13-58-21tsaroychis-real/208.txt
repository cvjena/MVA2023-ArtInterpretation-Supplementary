The painting is a study of character, with the man bearing a strong expression, as though he is in a rush. He has a moustache, indicating that he is older, and the darkness around his eyes gives him a sense of mystery. Alternatively, the man could be portrayed as arrogant or vain. The unfinished state of the painting could suggest that the artist is still working on the portrait. Hayez's use of deep blue, cool green, and sharp black and white create a sense of detachment, as though the viewer is looking at the subject from a faraway place. The painting is based on a real person, possibly a nomad woman, and the man is looking at her attentively.
