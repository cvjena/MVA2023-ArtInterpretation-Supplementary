The painting is centered around a angel who stands against a dramatic sky which is filled with swirling clouds and bright stars. She is depicted as a magnificent figure, with wings spread out and a gentle expression on her face. She might be accompanying someone who is about to enter into Heaven, or she might be show standing as a guardian over a holy place. The painting is brightly painted, with a heavenly atmosphere and seems to be bursting with life. It could be interpreted as a symbol of faith and hope, or it could be interpreted as a religious work of art. A possible interpretation could be that the angel is representing the power and influence of those who are looking up to her, and that the painting is a symbol of her protection.
