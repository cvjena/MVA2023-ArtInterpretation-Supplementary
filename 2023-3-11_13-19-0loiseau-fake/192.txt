In this painting, the stormy ocean is depicted with a majestic, stark power. Wind and water whip the waves into foam, while the darkness and distance accentuate the enormity of the scene. The sleek lines and horizontals of the ship and waves form a coherent composition that is both dynamic and mesmerizing. The painting could represent the power and majesty of the ocean on the brink of stormy weather, or simply the terror and isolation of the ocean at night. A possible interpretation could be that the ship is representing the human experience of struggle and change, and the waves are a symbol for the unstoppable power of nature.
