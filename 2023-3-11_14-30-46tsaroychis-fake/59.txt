The painting is set in a rural area with a river flowing past. There are trees and other plants in the background. The river is very wide and has a lot of banks. On one bank there is a very large building that might be a castle. There are other people in the painting, but they are not very close to the river. The painting is very wide and has a lot of details. It might be a very detailed painting.      A possible interpretation could be that the painting is a representation of the nature in general, and the river in particular. The bank in the painting might be a representation of the banks in the surrounding area, and the building might be a representation of the government or other important figures.
