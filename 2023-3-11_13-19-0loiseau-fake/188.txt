The painting depicts a stormy night with big waves crashing against the shore. The deep blue ocean and dark clouds look ominous, as if they could surge in any moment and swamp the coastline. High winds are whipping through the trees and the waves seem to be growing higher and higher. The scene is static, with no detail or colourpainted in for emphasis, providing a sense of maximum drama and intensity. The artist may have been trying to convey the feeling of impending doom, as well as the fear and apprehension that comes with tumultuous natural events. The painting could be interpreted as a metaphor for the Russian Revolution, which was happening at the time the painting was made.
