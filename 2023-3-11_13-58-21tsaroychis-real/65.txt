This painting was created in 1849 during Shevchenko's travels to Kazakhstan. The painting portrays a Kazakh family inside their yurt, which is a traditional Mongolian-style dwelling. The colors are natural, and the mural is composed of overlapping thin brushstrokes that create a three-dimensional effect. The patriarch, wearing a conical sheep-skin hat and a colorful robe, is seated on the ground in front of the yurt, with his children standing behind him. Shevchenko was able to capture the energy and warmth of the Kazakh people vividly in this painting. It is a reminder of the country's rich history and history of its people.
