This painting is a breathtaking view of the Himalayas from the top of Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. The mountains are a deep blue and are highlighted with white snowcaps and glaciers. The sky is a light blue, with fluffy white clouds. There are several villages in the distance, and the sun is just starting to set behind the mountains. This painting is a beautiful representation of nature and everyday life. It is said that Tissot was inspired to paint this picture after spending a summer there. The mountains in the background are a source of inspiration for her work, and the painting is a perfect example of the peaceful, natural beauty scenery that she uses.
