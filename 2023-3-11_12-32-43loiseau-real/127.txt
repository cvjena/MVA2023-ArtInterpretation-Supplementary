This painting features a self-portrait of the artist, looking in the mirror with a furrowed brow. The background appears to be made up of a multitude of broken, jagged pieces of glass. The artist's hands are slightly clenched, as if in a gesture of frustration or anger. The muted colors and desolate expanse of the background creates a sense of loneliness and isolation. The artist's striking features could be seen as a metaphor for the broken life of the artist, or it could be seen as a representation of the broken world he observed in his life.  There are several possible interpretations of this painting.
