In this painting, the artist captures a candid moment as the model fixes her hair in a mirror. She is looking straight ahead, revealing her profile and the curve of her spine. Her skin is delicate and flawless, and the back of her neck is smooth and pale. Her black hair is sleek and stylish, and the artist has captured the sensual elegance of her features. The composition is simple, but the details are striking. This painting is a compelling portrayal of feminine beauty and sensuality. It could be interpreted as a commentary on the power and privilege of women at the time, or as a statement about the way that women were often seen as objects rather than people. It could be seen as a celebration of the female form.
