This portrait features the famed Russian author Feodor Dostoyevsky in a portray that caught his facial features at a very pivotal point in his life. The facial features are sharp and defined, with a certain intensity that seems to radiate from the canvas. The eyes seem to be staring off into the distance and the mouth is slightly open, suggesting a sense of contemplation or intensity. It is interesting to note that the painter chose to paint Dostoyevsky in profile, which gives the painting a moreephemeral quality. It is possible that the artist was attempting to create a sense of timelessness and detachment from the world around him.
