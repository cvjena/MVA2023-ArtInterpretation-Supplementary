This painting is a study of human form. The sitter is seen from the front, with her bare shoulders, upper arms and breasts exposed, and her back is to the viewer. The skin tones are dark, suggesting the artist’s examination of caucasian skin in comparison to olive skin. There is an air of serenity and calmness in the sitter’s expression, reminiscent of a classical statue, while her hair falls in waves around her shoulders.  The most striking feature of this painting is the use of light and shadow. The sitter’s eyes are in sharp focus, while the shadows give the impression of depth.
