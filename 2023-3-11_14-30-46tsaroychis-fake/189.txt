The painting depicts the moment when Christ is baptized by John the Baptist. John is standing in the center, holding Christ's clothes and next to him is an angel. Christ is flanked by two women who are probably his mother and sister. They appear to be awestruck by the scene. Around them, there are other people who are gazing at the scene with astonishment. This painting is touching because it portrays the wonderment and amazement of the people who were there. It is a religious work that tells the story of the arrival of the Christan god to a part of the world. The artist used rich, saturated colors to create a dramatic and powerful image. It is a striking example of Renaissance art.
